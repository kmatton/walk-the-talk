Other findings can include hypothermia and hypotension.

WPW syndrome is a type of ventricular preexcitation syndrome in which an accessory pathway (the bundle of Kent) bypasses the AV node and directly connects the atria and ventricles. This results in early partial depolarization of the ventricles (delta wave) and a shortened PR interval. \\n\\nPatients with WPW syndrome are at risk for developing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) due to reentry circuits. Symptoms of SVT include palpitations, dizziness, and syncope. In this patient, the episodes of syncope in loud, crowded environments are likely due to an abrupt onset of SVT triggered by surges of adrenaline.\\n\\nThe treatment of choice for symptomatic WPW syndrome is radiofrequency catheter ablation of the accessory pathway. However, if the patient is not a suitable candidate for ablation or declines the procedure, medical therapy with a beta-blocker or a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) can be used to control the heart rate during episodes of SVT.\\n\\nSo, the answer is [C].\\n\\n## List all options from most likely to least likely\\nAnswer: [C] > [B] > [A] > [D].'}]}"
