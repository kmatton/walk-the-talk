It addresses distorted body image and unhealthy eating behaviors.\n\n2. **In-patient psychiatric therapy:**\n   - This might be necessary initially if the patient is severely malnourished or at risk of severe complications. However, it is not necessarily the best long-term management unless the patient's condition is critical.\n\n3. **Antidepressants:**\n   - These can be used as adjunct therapy but are not the primary long-term treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n\n4. **Appetite stimulants:**\n   - These are not typically used to treat anorexia nervosa and do not address the underlying psychological issues.\n\nGiven the patient's condition and the need for a sustainable, long-term treatment approach that addresses both her psychological and behavioral issues, **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** is the best option.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
