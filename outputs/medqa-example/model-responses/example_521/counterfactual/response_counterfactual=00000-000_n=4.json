Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT):**\n     - CBT is a well-established treatment for eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa.\n     - It helps patients address distorted thinking patterns and behaviors related to food and body image.\n   - **B. In-patient psychiatric therapy:**\n     - In severe cases, especially when medical stability is a concern, in-patient treatment may be necessary.\n     - This includes medical monitoring, nutritional support, and intensive psychotherapy.\n   - **C. Antidepressants:**\n     - While antidepressants can be helpful for co-occurring depression or anxiety, they are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n   - **D. Appetite stimulants:**\n     - These are not commonly used for treating anorexia nervosa as they do not address the underlying psychological issues.\n\nGiven the patient's severe presentation and refusal of intravenous fluids and hospital meals, in-patient psychiatric therapy would ensure safety and provide comprehensive care, including medical, nutritional, and psychological support.\n\nTherefore, the best option for long-term management of this patient\u2019s condition is:\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
