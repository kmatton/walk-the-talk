Anorexia nervosa often requires a multifaceted approach for long-term management, which can include medical treatment, nutritional rehabilitation, and psychological support. \n\nLet's analyze the options provided:\n\nA. Cognitive-behavioral therapy - This is a highly effective form of psychotherapy that helps patients understand and change their thinking and behavior patterns. It is often considered a first-line treatment for eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa.\n\nB. In-patient psychiatric therapy - This may be necessary for patients who are severely malnourished or at risk of immediate harm. However, it is not typically a long-term management strategy but rather an acute intervention.\n\nC. Antidepressants - While medications can be helpful, especially if there is a coexisting mood disorder like depression, they are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa and should not be the sole focus of long-term management.\n\nD. Appetite stimulants - These are rarely used in the treatment of anorexia nervosa because the issue is not a lack of appetite but rather a complex psychological disorder involving body image and fear of gaining weight.\n\nGiven that cognitive-behavioral therapy helps address the underlying psychological issues and is effective in treating eating disorders, it is the most appropriate option for long-term management.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
