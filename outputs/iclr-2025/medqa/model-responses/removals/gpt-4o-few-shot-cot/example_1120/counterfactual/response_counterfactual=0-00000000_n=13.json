{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when they lie down. They also complain of difficulty walking upstairs and say they recently started to wear adult diapers because they seem to have difficulty controlling their bowel movements. Their vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of their symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, we need to evaluate the clinical presentation and the findings from the examination.\n\n1. **Back pain for 2 months:**\n   - Chronic back pain could be due to multiple etiologies, including musculoskeletal issues, spinal metastasis, or other spinal pathologies.\n\n2. **Pain present throughout the day and at night:**\n   - Pain that is persistent and not relieved by rest raises concern for a pathological process such as malignancy.\n\n3. **Difficulty walking upstairs and bowel incontinence:**\n   - These symptoms suggest a possible neurological compromise, affecting both motor and autonomic functions.\n\n4. **Neurological examination findings:**\n   - Bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense point towards a significant spinal cord involvement.\n\n5. **Rectal examination findings:**\n   - A hard nodular mass and weak rectal sphincter tone suggest the possibility of a pelvic mass, which could be pressing on the spinal cord or nerves.\n\nLet's evaluate each option in light of the above findings:\n\nA. **Syringomyelia:**\n   - This is a cystic enlargement of the spinal cord. Symptoms usually progress slowly and may include loss of pain and temperature sensation in a \"cape-like\" distribution. However, it is less likely to cause a hard nodular mass or involve the rectal sphincter directly.\n\nB. **Spinal metastasis:**\n   - Spinal metastasis can cause persistent back pain, especially at night. It can lead to spinal cord compression, causing bilateral lower limb weakness, sensory changes, and bowel/bladder incontinence. The presence of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination suggests a potential primary malignancy (e.g., prostate cancer) that has metastasized to the spine.\n\nC. **Herniated disc:**\n   - While a herniated disc can cause back pain and radicular symptoms, it is less likely to cause a hard nodular mass on rectal examination. Additionally, a herniated disc typically does not cause bilateral neurological deficits and bowel incontinence unless it is a very large central herniation, which would be less common.\n\nD. **Spinal hematoma:**\n   - A spinal hematoma can cause acute onset of back pain and neurological deficits. However, it is less likely to present with a hard nodular mass on rectal examination and would typically have a more acute history rather than a chronic one.\n\nGiven the chronic nature of the symptoms, the hard nodular mass on rectal examination, and the neurological findings, spinal metastasis is the most likely cause.\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
