{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down. He also complains of difficulty walking upstairs and says he recently started to wear adult diapers because he seems to have difficulty controlling his bowel movements. His vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Back Pain**: The patient experiences back pain that is persistent throughout the day and night, which suggests a serious underlying condition.\n2. **Difficulty Walking Upstairs**: This symptom indicates possible lower limb weakness.\n3. **Bowel Incontinence**: Wearing adult diapers due to difficulty controlling bowel movements indicates a significant neurological impairment affecting the sacral nerves.\n4. **Neurological Examination**:\n   - Bilateral lower limb weakness.\n   - Diminished temperature sensation.\n   - Decreased vibratory sense.\n5. **Rectal Examination**: Presence of a hard nodular mass and weak rectal sphincter tone.\n\nGiven these symptoms, let's evaluate the potential causes:\n\nA. **Syringomyelia**:\n   - Typically presents with a \"cape-like\" distribution of sensory loss affecting the upper extremities.\n   - Unlikely to cause a hard nodular mass on rectal examination or bowel incontinence in this manner.\n\nB. **Spinal Metastasis**:\n   - Commonly causes persistent back pain, which can be worse at night.\n   - Can lead to weakness, sensory deficits, and bowel/bladder dysfunction due to compression of spinal cord or nerves.\n   - The hard nodular mass on rectal examination suggests a possible metastatic lesion, for instance, from prostate cancer.\n\nC. **Herniated Disc**:\n   - Typically causes localized back pain and radicular pain (shooting pain along a nerve path).\n   - Less likely to cause bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, decreased vibratory sense, and bowel incontinence simultaneously.\n\nD. **Spinal Hematoma**:\n   - Can cause severe back pain and neurological deficits, but it is an acute condition and typically follows trauma or anticoagulation therapy.\n   - Unlikely to present with a hard nodular mass on rectal examination.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the findings of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination, **spinal metastasis** is the most likely cause. The mass is suggestive of a primary cancer (such as prostate cancer) that has metastasized to the spine, leading to neurological symptoms due to spinal cord compression.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
