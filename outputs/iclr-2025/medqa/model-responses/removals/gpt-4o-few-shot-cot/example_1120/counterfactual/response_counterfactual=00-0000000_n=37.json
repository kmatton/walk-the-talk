{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down. He also complains of difficulty walking upstairs and says he recently started to wear adult diapers because he seems to have difficulty controlling his bowel movements. His vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, let's analyze the key findings:\n\n1. **Pain throughout the day and night when lying down**: This could suggest a persistent, possibly severe condition.\n2. **Difficulty walking upstairs**: Indicates lower limb weakness.\n3. **Incontinence**: Suggests possible spinal cord or nerve involvement.\n4. **Neurological examination**:\n   - Bilateral lower limb weakness\n   - Diminished temperature sensation\n   - Decreased vibratory sense\n   - Hard nodular mass on rectal examination\n   - Weak rectal sphincter tone\n\nGiven these findings, we can evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Syringomyelia**: This condition involves the development of a fluid-filled cyst within the spinal cord. It typically presents with a \"cape-like\" distribution of sensory loss over the shoulders and arms, which is not consistent with this patient's symptoms.\n\nB. **Spinal metastasis**: Cancer metastases to the spine can cause back pain, neurological deficits, and incontinence. The hard nodular mass found on rectal examination suggests a possibility of prostate cancer metastasizing to the spine, which could explain the bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished sensation, and incontinence.\n\nC. **Herniated disc**: Typically causes radicular pain, numbness, and weakness in a dermatomal distribution. It usually doesn't present with a hard nodular mass or the severity of symptoms described here, especially incontinence.\n\nD. **Spinal hematoma**: This would present with acute onset of severe back pain and neurological deficits. The chronic nature of this patient's symptoms makes this less likely.\n\nGiven the chronic nature of the symptoms, presence of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination, and the neurological deficits, spinal metastasis from a likely prostate cancer seems to be the most plausible diagnosis.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
