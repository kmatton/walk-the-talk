{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down. He also complains of difficulty walking upstairs and says he recently started to wear adult diapers because he seems to have difficulty controlling his bowel movements. His vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, we need to consider all the provided information:\n\n- **Back pain for 2 months**: This duration suggests a chronic process.\n- **Pain present throughout the day and night**: This indicates that the pain is not relieved by rest.\n- **Difficulty walking upstairs**: Suggests possible muscle weakness or neurological impairment.\n- **Recent onset of bowel incontinence**: Indicates involvement of sacral nerves or spinal cord.\n- **Vital signs are normal**: No signs of acute infection or systemic illness.\n- **Neurological examination**:\n  - **Bilateral lower limb weakness**: Suggests a possible spinal cord issue.\n  - **Diminished temperature sensation**: Involvement of the spinothalamic tract.\n  - **Decreased vibratory sense**: Involvement of the dorsal columns.\n  - **Weak rectal sphincter tone**: Indicates involvement of the lower sacral spinal cord or cauda equina.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Syringomyelia**: Typically presents with a cape-like distribution of sensory loss in the upper extremities due to cystic enlargement of the central canal of the spinal cord. This does not fit the patient's presentation of lower limb symptoms and bowel incontinence.\n\nB. **Spinal metastasis**: Can cause chronic back pain that is unrelieved by rest, neurological deficits, and bowel/bladder dysfunction due to compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina. The patient's age and presentation of symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nC. **Herniated disc**: Can cause back pain and neurological symptoms but typically does not cause bowel incontinence unless it is a severe large central disc herniation causing cauda equina syndrome. However, the chronicity and bilateral nature of symptoms make this less likely.\n\nD. **Spinal hematoma**: Typically presents acutely with severe pain and rapid development of neurological deficits. The chronic nature of this patient's symptoms makes this less likely.\n\nConsidering the chronicity of the symptoms, the involvement of both sensory and motor pathways, and the development of bowel incontinence, the most likely cause is spinal metastasis.\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
