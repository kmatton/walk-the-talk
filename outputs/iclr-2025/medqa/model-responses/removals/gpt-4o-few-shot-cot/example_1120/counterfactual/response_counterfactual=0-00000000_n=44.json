{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when they lie down. They also complain of difficulty walking upstairs and say they recently started to wear adult diapers because they seem to have difficulty controlling their bowel movements. Their vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of their symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "The presentation of back pain, bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished sensation, difficulty controlling bowel movements, and a hard nodular mass on rectal examination suggests a serious underlying condition.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Persistent Back Pain**: The patient experiences back pain throughout the day and night, which is not typical for benign causes like a herniated disc.\n\n2. **Neurological Symptoms**: Bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense point towards a possible spinal cord or nerve root involvement.\n\n3. **Bowel Incontinence**: The loss of bowel control suggests involvement of the sacral nerves, which control bowel and bladder function.\n\n4. **Rectal Examination**: The presence of a hard nodular mass is highly suggestive of a malignancy, which could be causing secondary spinal issues.\n\nGiven these findings, the most likely diagnosis is spinal metastasis. This condition can present with back pain, neurological deficits, and signs of systemic malignancy (such as a hard nodular mass in the rectum, which could be a primary cancer site like prostate cancer metastasizing to the spine).\n\n- **Syringomyelia** typically presents with a \"cape-like\" distribution of sensory loss and is less likely without trauma or congenital malformations.\n- **Herniated disc** would not typically cause a hard nodular mass on rectal examination and is less likely to cause such profound systemic and neurological symptoms.\n- **Spinal hematoma** is often associated with acute onset of symptoms, particularly after trauma or a procedure, and does not align with the chronic nature of this patient's symptoms and the presence of a hard nodular mass.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe combination of systemic signs (e.g., nodular mass), persistent pain, and progressive neurological deficits strongly suggests spinal metastasis.\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
