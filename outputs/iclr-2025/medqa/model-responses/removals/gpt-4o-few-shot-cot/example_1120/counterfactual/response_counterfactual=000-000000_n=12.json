{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down. He also complains of difficulty walking upstairs and says he recently started to wear adult diapers because he seems to have difficulty controlling his bowel movements. His vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question step-by-step, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and consider the possible diagnoses:\n\n1. **Back pain present throughout the day and night**: This suggests a more severe and constant issue, possibly involving structural or malignant causes.\n\n2. **Difficulty walking upstairs**: This could imply muscle weakness or neurological impairment.\n\n3. **Difficulty controlling bowel movements and wearing adult diapers**: This indicates a possible neurological compromise affecting the bowel control centers.\n\n4. **Vital signs within normal limits**: This doesn\u2019t rule out any of the conditions but indicates no acute infection or systemic illness at the moment.\n\n5. **Neurological examination findings**:\n   - **Bilateral lower limb weakness**: Suggests a lesion affecting motor pathways.\n   - **Diminished temperature sensation**: Suggests involvement of the pain and temperature pathways.\n   - **Decreased vibratory sense**: Suggests involvement of the posterior columns of the spinal cord.\n\n6. **Rectal examination findings**:\n   - **Hard nodular mass**: This is highly suggestive of a prostate issue, possibly prostate cancer.\n   - **Weak rectal sphincter tone**: Suggests spinal cord involvement affecting the nerves controlling the sphincter.\n\nGiven these findings, let's consider the options:\n\nA. **Syringomyelia**: Typically presents with a \"cape-like\" distribution of sensory loss (pain and temperature) and doesn't usually cause hard nodular masses in the rectum or difficulty controlling bowel movements.\n\nB. **Spinal metastasis**: This is highly likely given the patient's age, the presence of a hard nodular mass (suggestive of potential prostate cancer), and neurological symptoms indicating spinal cord involvement. Metastasis to the spine can cause direct compression of the spinal cord, leading to the symptoms described.\n\nC. **Herniated disc**: Generally causes localized pain and radicular symptoms, which might include muscle weakness and sensory changes, but it would be less likely to cause a hard nodular mass in the rectum, and it\u2019s less commonly associated with bowel control issues in the absence of severe cauda equina syndrome.\n\nD. **Spinal hematoma**: This would typically present acutely and often follows trauma or a procedure. While it can cause compressive symptoms, the history and gradual progression of symptoms in this patient make it less likely.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is spinal metastasis.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
