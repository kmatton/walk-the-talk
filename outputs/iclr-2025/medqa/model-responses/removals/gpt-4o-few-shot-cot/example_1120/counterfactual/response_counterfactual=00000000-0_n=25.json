{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down. He also complains of difficulty walking upstairs and says he recently started to wear adult diapers because he seems to have difficulty controlling his bowel movements. His vital signs are within normal limits. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, let's carefully analyze the provided information.\n\n1. **Back pain for 2 months**: Persistent back pain, especially if it is present both day and night, can be concerning for a serious underlying condition.\n2. **Pain present at night**: This often raises suspicion for malignancies or severe spinal conditions.\n3. **Difficulty walking upstairs**: This could indicate a neurological impairment potentially affecting strength or coordination.\n4. **Difficulty controlling bowel movements**: This is a significant symptom, suggesting a possible neurological compromise involving the spinal cord or nerves.\n5. **Rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass**: This strongly suggests a possible malignancy.\n6. **Weak rectal sphincter tone**: Indicative of a potential neurological impairment.\n\nGiven these findings, let's examine the options:\n\nA. **Syringomyelia**: Typically presents with a \"cape-like\" distribution of sensory loss over the shoulders and arms. It is less likely to present with a hard nodular mass on rectal examination and bowel incontinence.\n\nB. **Spinal metastasis**: This is highly plausible. Spinal metastasis can present with persistent back pain, neurological deficits, and symptoms of bowel or bladder incontinence. A hard nodular mass on rectal examination could suggest a primary malignancy such as prostate cancer, which commonly metastasizes to the spine.\n\nC. **Herniated disc**: Can cause back pain and possible radiculopathy, but is less likely to be associated with a hard nodular mass on rectal examination and persistent pain at night. It also typically would not cause bowel incontinence unless there is a severe case like cauda equina syndrome, which usually presents acutely.\n\nD. **Spinal hematoma**: Can cause back pain and neurological symptoms but would typically present acutely, often following trauma or anticoagulation therapy. It would not explain the hard nodular mass found on rectal examination.\n\nGiven the combination of persistent back pain, neurological symptoms, and the finding of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination, the most likely diagnosis is spinal metastasis.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
