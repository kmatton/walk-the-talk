{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down. He also complains of difficulty walking upstairs. His vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To answer this question, we need to consider the patient's presenting symptoms and findings.\n\n1. **Back Pain and Night Pain**: The fact that the pain is present throughout the day and night, even when lying down, points towards a serious underlying condition rather than a simple musculoskeletal issue. Night pain is particularly concerning and often points towards malignancy.\n\n2. **Difficulty Walking Upstairs**: This suggests a potential neurological compromise affecting the lower extremities.\n\n3. **Neurological Examination Findings**:\n   - **Bilateral lower limb weakness**: This indicates a significant neurological issue affecting motor function.\n   - **Diminished temperature sensation and decreased vibratory sense**: These symptoms suggest a problem with both the spinothalamic tract (temperature sensation) and the dorsal columns (vibratory sense).\n\n4. **Rectal Examination**:\n   - **Hard nodular mass**: This finding is highly suggestive of prostate cancer.\n   - **Weak rectal sphincter tone**: This indicates involvement of the spinal cord or cauda equina.\n\nGiven these findings, the most likely cause of his symptoms is metastatic prostate cancer to the spine. Prostate cancer often metastasizes to the bones, including the spine, and can lead to spinal cord compression, which explains the neurological deficits observed.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. **Syringomyelia**: This condition involves the formation of a cyst within the spinal cord and typically presents with a \u201ccape-like\u201d distribution of sensory loss, particularly affecting pain and temperature sensation. It does not explain the hard nodular mass found on rectal examination.\n\nB. **Spinal metastasis**: This is consistent with the patient\u2019s symptoms and findings. The hard nodular mass on rectal exam suggests prostate cancer, which commonly metastasizes to the spine, causing pain, neurological deficits, and sphincter dysfunction.\n\nC. **Herniated disc**: While a herniated disc can cause back pain and neurological symptoms, it does not explain the hard nodular mass found on rectal examination, nor does it typically present with such extensive neurological findings (bilateral weakness, diminished temperature sensation, decreased vibratory sense).\n\nD. **Spinal hematoma**: This condition can cause back pain and neurological deficits, but it is less likely given the chronic nature of the symptoms and the presence of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination.\n\nConsidering all the evidence, the most likely diagnosis is spinal metastasis, particularly secondary to prostate cancer.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
