{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when they lie down. They also complain of difficulty walking upstairs and say they recently started to wear adult diapers because they seem to have difficulty controlling their bowel movements. Their vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of their symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, we need to analyze the clinical presentation carefully.\n\n1. **Back pain for the past 2 months**: This chronic pain could be indicative of an ongoing pathological process.\n2. **Pain present throughout the day and night**: Constant pain, including at rest, is often associated with more serious underlying conditions.\n3. **Difficulty walking upstairs**: This suggests muscle weakness or neurological impairment.\n4. **Difficulty controlling bowel movements and wearing adult diapers**: This indicates a possible neurological deficit affecting the sacral nerves.\n5. **Vital signs within normal limits**: This provides no additional clues towards systemic infection or acute conditions.\n6. **Bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense**: These are signs of significant neurological impairment.\n7. **Rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and weak rectal sphincter tone**: The presence of a hard nodular mass is highly suggestive of a neoplastic process, likely prostate cancer with spinal metastasis, given the patient's age.\n\nGiven these symptoms, the most likely cause is spinal metastasis. This is supported by the presence of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination, indicating a likely primary cancer (e.g., prostate cancer) that has metastasized to the spine, leading to neurological symptoms and back pain.\n\n**Analysis of other options:**\n- **A. Syringomyelia**: Typically presents with a cape-like distribution of sensory loss and is less likely to cause a hard nodular mass on rectal examination.\n- **C. Herniated disc**: Would typically cause more localized radicular pain without a hard nodular mass and is less likely to cause systemic neurological deficits or bowel/bladder incontinence.\n- **D. Spinal hematoma**: Usually presents with acute onset of symptoms and is not associated with a hard nodular mass.\n\nTherefore, considering the clinical presentation and the findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
