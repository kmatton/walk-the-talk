{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down. He also complains of difficulty walking upstairs and says he recently started to wear adult diapers because he seems to have difficulty controlling his bowel movements. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, we need to carefully evaluate the details provided:\n\n1. **Back pain for the past 2 months**: This persistent pain suggests a chronic condition.\n2. **Pain present even at night when lying down**: This indicates that the pain is not solely mechanical but possibly indicative of a more serious underlying issue.\n3. **Difficulty walking upstairs**: This may point to muscle weakness or neurological impairment.\n4. **Difficulty controlling bowel movements and wearing adult diapers**: Indicates potential neurological involvement affecting the sphincter control.\n5. **Neurological examination**: Reveals bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense, which indicates a possible issue affecting the spinal cord.\n6. **Rectal examination**: Reveals a hard nodular mass and weak rectal sphincter tone, which is highly suggestive of a pathological lesion in the pelvis or lower spine.\n\nGiven these symptoms, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Syringomyelia**: This condition typically causes a \"cape-like\" distribution of sensory loss and is more common in the cervical region of the spinal cord. It does not usually present with a hard nodular mass on rectal exam.\n\nB. **Spinal metastasis**: This condition can cause persistent back pain that is worse at night, neurological deficits such as bilateral lower limb weakness, sensory changes, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. The presence of a hard nodular mass on rectal exam could suggest prostate cancer metastasis to the spine.\n\nC. **Herniated disc**: Typically causes radicular pain and possibly some motor deficits, but it is less likely to cause bowel/bladder dysfunction and the systemic symptoms described here. It does not present with a hard nodular mass on rectal exam.\n\nD. **Spinal hematoma**: This condition can cause acute or subacute back pain and neurological deficits. However, it is less likely to cause a hard nodular mass on rectal exam and the chronic symptomatology described in this case.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is spinal metastasis, particularly given the combination of persistent pain, neurological deficits, and the finding of a hard nodular mass on rectal exam.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
