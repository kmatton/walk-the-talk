{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when they lie down. They also complain of difficulty walking upstairs and say they recently started to wear adult diapers because they seem to have difficulty controlling their bowel movements. Their vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of their symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, let's break down the key symptoms and clinical findings:\n\n1. **Back Pain**: Persistent and present throughout the day and night, including when lying down.\n2. **Difficulty Walking Upstairs**: Indicative of lower limb weakness.\n3. **Incontinence**: Difficulty controlling bowel movements, requiring adult diapers.\n4. **Neurological Examination**: Bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, decreased vibratory sense.\n5. **Rectal Examination**: Hard nodular mass and weak rectal sphincter tone.\n\nGiven these findings, we can analyze each option:\n\nA. **Syringomyelia**:\n   - Syringomyelia usually presents with a cape-like distribution of sensory loss (loss of pain and temperature sensation over the shoulders and arms), which is not described here. Also, weakness and sensory loss typically don't progress to the severity described here in the early stages.\n\nB. **Spinal Metastasis**:\n   - Spinal metastasis can cause back pain that is constant and worsens at night. It can also lead to neurological deficits due to spinal cord compression, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished sensation, and decreased sphincter tone. The hard nodular mass on rectal examination suggests a primary malignancy, likely prostate cancer, that has metastasized to the spine.\n\nC. **Herniated Disc**:\n   - A herniated disc typically causes radicular pain, which is usually more acute and associated with specific movements. It is less likely to cause such severe and generalized symptoms as described, including bowel incontinence and a hard nodular mass on rectal examination.\n\nD. **Spinal Hematoma**:\n   - A spinal hematoma could cause severe back pain and neurological deficits, but it typically presents acutely after trauma or anticoagulation therapy. The chronic nature of the symptoms and the presence of a hard nodular mass make this less likely.\n\nConsidering the chronic nature, the presence of neurological deficits, and the hard nodular mass on rectal examination, **spinal metastasis** is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
