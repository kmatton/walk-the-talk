{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down. He also complains of difficulty walking upstairs and says he recently started to wear adult diapers because he seems to have difficulty controlling his bowel movements. His vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?\nA. Syringomyelia\nB. Spinal metastasis\nC. Herniated disc\nD. Spinal hematoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, let's analyze the clinical findings and match them to the options provided.\n\n### Clinical Findings:\n1. **Persistent pain** throughout the day and at night.\n2. **Difficulty walking upstairs**.\n3. **Recent onset of bowel incontinence** and the need for adult diapers.\n4. **Bilateral lower limb weakness**.\n5. **Diminished temperature sensation**.\n6. **Decreased vibratory sense**.\n7. **Rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass** and weak rectal sphincter tone.\n\n### Differential Analysis:\n- **Syringomyelia**:\n  - Typically presents with a \"cape-like\" distribution of sensory loss (loss of pain and temperature sensation over the shoulders and arms).\n  - This patient has bilateral lower limb weakness and diminished temperature sensation, which could fit; however, the presence of a hard nodular mass is not explained by syringomyelia.\n\n- **Spinal metastasis**:\n  - Can cause back pain that is persistent and worsens at night.\n  - Often associated with neurological deficits such as bilateral lower limb weakness.\n  - The hard nodular mass on rectal examination is suggestive of a possible prostate involvement, which could metastasize to the spine.\n  - Bowel and bladder dysfunction can also be seen in spinal metastasis due to compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina.\n\n- **Herniated disc**:\n  - Typically presents with radicular pain (shooting pain down the leg) and may cause lower limb weakness.\n  - Usually does not include systemic symptoms like decreased temperature sensation and decreased vibratory sense.\n  - Unlikely to explain the hard nodular mass or the bowel incontinence.\n\n- **Spinal hematoma**:\n  - Generally presents acutely with severe pain and rapid onset of neurological deficits.\n  - A history of trauma or anticoagulant use is common.\n  - The chronic nature of the symptoms and the presence of the hard nodular mass make this less likely.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the chronic nature of the symptoms, the presence of a hard nodular mass suggestive of a possible malignancy, and the combination of bilateral lower limb weakness, sensory deficits, and bowel incontinence, **spinal metastasis** is the most likely cause.\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
