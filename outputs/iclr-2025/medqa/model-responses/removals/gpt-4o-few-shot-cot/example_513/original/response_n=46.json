{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?\nA. Germ cells\nB. Chorionic epithelial cells\nC. Endometrial cells\nD. Stromal cells\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve the question step-by-step, let's first take into account the relevant details provided:\n\n1. **Dragging pelvic pain**\n2. **Weight loss over the past 6 months**\n3. **Irregular menses**\n4. **Temperature of 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F)**\n5. **Heart rate of 102/min**\n6. **Hyperreflexia**\n7. **Negative urine pregnancy test**\n8. **Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass**\n\nGiven these symptoms, the presence of a hypoechoic adnexal mass is a key finding. The differential diagnosis would include various types of ovarian masses or tumors. The clinical presentation and the characteristics of the mass need to be correlated with the most likely cell type of origin.\n\n**Possible Cell Types:**\n\nA. **Germ cells**: Germ cell tumors can occur in women of reproductive age and might include dysgerminomas, teratomas, or other germ cell tumors. These often present with an adnexal mass and can cause systemic symptoms.\n\nB. **Chorionic epithelial cells**: These cells are related to trophoblastic diseases such as choriocarcinoma, which typically would involve positive pregnancy tests due to elevated hCG levels.\n\nC. **Endometrial cells**: While endometriosis can cause pelvic pain and irregular menses, it typically does not present with a hypoechoic adnexal mass of this size.\n\nD. **Stromal cells**: Stromal cell tumors, such as granulosa cell tumors, can present with pelvic pain, a mass, and other systemic symptoms including hormonal changes due to the secretion of estrogen or other substances.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- **Germ cell tumors**: Often present with pain and systemic symptoms, but less commonly with irregular menses and hyperreflexia.\n- **Trophoblastic disease**: Unlikely due to negative pregnancy test.\n- **Endometriosis**: Unlikely to present with a solitary 6-cm hypoechoic mass.\n- **Stromal cell tumors**: Likely to present with a mass, pain, and systemic symptoms. Hyperreflexia might be associated secondary to hormonal changes (e.g., hyperthyroidism).\n\nGiven the combination of symptoms and the ultrasonographic finding, a stromal cell tumor (option D) is the most likely cause of the adnexal mass and associated symptoms.\n\n**Answer: D**", "answer": "D"}
