{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?\nA. Germ cells\nB. Chorionic epithelial cells\nC. Endometrial cells\nD. Stromal cells\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the origin of the adnexal mass in this 31-year-old woman, we need to consider the clinical presentation and the characteristics of the mass.\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**:\n   - The patient has been experiencing pelvic pain and weight loss over the past 6 months.\n   - She has irregular menstrual cycles and hyperreflexia, which could suggest hormonal imbalances.\n   - There is a slight fever, which could indicate an inflammatory or infectious process, though not necessarily specific to the type of mass.\n\n2. **Ultrasonography**:\n   - The presence of a 6-cm hypoechoic mass in the adnexa (the area adjacent to the uterus, including the ovaries and fallopian tubes).\n\n3. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Germ cells**: Often give rise to masses like teratomas or germ cell tumors (e.g., dysgerminomas), which can be hypoechoic but often have more complex features.\n   - **Chorionic epithelial cells**: These are part of the placenta and related to gestational trophoblastic diseases, which would be less likely given the negative pregnancy test.\n   - **Endometrial cells**: Endometriomas (chocolate cysts) could present as hypoechoic masses, but they are more commonly associated with endometriosis and cyclic pain.\n   - **Stromal cells**: Stromal cell tumors (e.g., fibromas, thecomas) can present as hypoechoic masses and are more likely to be hormonally active, which can explain the irregular menses and hyperreflexia.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation of pelvic pain, weight loss, irregular menstrual cycles, hyperreflexia, and a hypoechoic mass on ultrasonography, the most likely origin of the mass is from stromal cells, which are known to form hormonally active tumors (e.g., fibromas, thecomas) that can cause these symptoms.\n\n**Answer: D**", "answer": "D"}
