{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?\nA. Germ cells\nB. Chorionic epithelial cells\nC. Endometrial cells\nD. Stromal cells\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cell type from which the adnexal mass is derived, we need to consider the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and the characteristics of the mass.\n\n1. **Symptoms and Examination Findings:**\n   - **Dragging pelvic pain**: This could be caused by a mass exerting pressure on surrounding structures.\n   - **Weight loss**: This is a concerning sign that may indicate a more systemic process or malignancy.\n   - **Hyperreflexia**: This can be associated with hyperthyroidism, which can be linked to certain ovarian tumors like struma ovarii (a type of teratoma).\n   - **Temperature of 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F)**: This could indicate an inflammatory or infectious process, but it can also be seen with malignancy.\n   - **Heart rate of 102/min**: Tachycardia can be secondary to pain, fever, or hyperthyroidism.\n   - **Negative urine pregnancy test**: Rules out ectopic pregnancy as a cause of the adnexal mass.\n\n2. **Ultrasonography Findings:**\n   - **6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass**: Hypoechoic masses in the adnexa can be due to several types of ovarian tumors or cysts.\n\nGiven the combination of hyperreflexia, weight loss, and the adnexal mass, the most likely diagnosis is a type of ovarian neoplasm. Among the types of ovarian neoplasms, germ cell tumors (e.g., teratomas) are common in this age group and can present with a variety of symptoms, including endocrine symptoms if they contain functional thyroid tissue (struma ovarii).\n\n**Options Analysis:**\n- **A. Germ cells**: Germ cell tumors are common in women of reproductive age and can present with a variety of symptoms and types of masses.\n- **B. Chorionic epithelial cells**: These would be more characteristic of gestational trophoblastic disease, which is less likely given the negative pregnancy test.\n- **C. Endometrial cells**: Endometriomas typically present as \"chocolate cysts\" and are associated with endometriosis, not typically causing systemic symptoms like weight loss and hyperreflexia.\n- **D. Stromal cells**: Stromal tumors could occur, but they are less likely to present with the described systemic symptoms.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and the ultrasonographic findings, the most likely source of the adnexal mass is a germ cell tumor.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
