{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?\nA. Germ cells\nB. Chorionic epithelial cells\nC. Endometrial cells\nD. Stromal cells\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Given the information provided, let's analyze the scenario step-by-step to determine the most likely source of the adnexal mass.\n\n### Patient Presentation:\n- **Age:** 31-year-old woman\n- **Symptoms:** Irregular menses (30-45 day intervals), last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago\n- **Vital signs:** \n  - Temperature: 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F)\n  - Heart rate: 102/min\n  - Blood pressure: 128/84 mm Hg\n- **Physical examination:** Hyperreflexia\n- **Urine pregnancy test:** Negative\n- **Ultrasonography:** 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Irregular menses** suggests some hormonal or structural reproductive abnormality.\n- **Fever** (38\u00b0C) and **tachycardia** (heart rate of 102/min) could indicate an inflammatory or infectious process.\n- **Hyperreflexia** might be associated with hyperthyroidism or other systemic conditions.\n- **Adnexal mass**: The characteristics of the mass (hypoechoic) and its size (6 cm) are important for the differential diagnosis.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis and Cell Types:\n1. **Germ cells (A)**: These cells give rise to germ cell tumors, which can be benign (e.g., dermoid cysts) or malignant (e.g., dysgerminomas). Germ cell tumors are common in younger women.\n2. **Chorionic epithelial cells (B)**: These cells are involved in gestational trophoblastic disease, such as hydatidiform moles or choriocarcinoma. Given the negative pregnancy test, this is less likely.\n3. **Endometrial cells (C)**: Endometriosis or endometrial cysts (e.g., endometriomas) could present with an adnexal mass but are typically associated with cyclic pelvic pain and not commonly presenting with fever or tachycardia.\n4. **Stromal cells (D)**: These cells are part of the ovarian stroma and can give rise to stromal cell tumors (e.g., granulosa cell tumors). These tumors can secrete hormones leading to irregular menses and other systemic effects.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the combination of the irregular menses, hyperreflexia, fever, and a hypoechoic adnexal mass, a stromal cell origin is likely because stromal tumors can present with hormonal disturbances and systemic symptoms.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": "D"}
