{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?\nA. Germ cells\nB. Chorionic epithelial cells\nC. Endometrial cells\nD. Stromal cells\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To answer the question accurately, let's first analyze the patient's symptoms and the characteristics of the adnexal mass.\n\n- The patient has a 6-month history of dragging pelvic pain and weight loss.\n- Her menses are irregular with intervals of 30-45 days.\n- She has a slight fever (38\u00b0C) and an elevated heart rate (102/min).\n- The ultrasonography reveals a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass.\n\nGiven these details, we need to consider the types of cells that can form adnexal masses and their characteristics.\n\n### Cell Types and Associated Masses:\n1. **Germ Cells**: These cells can give rise to germ cell tumors, which include teratomas, dysgerminomas, and endodermal sinus tumors. Germ cell tumors are often found in younger women and can present with pelvic pain and an adnexal mass.\n   \n2. **Chorionic Epithelial Cells**: These cells are involved in gestational trophoblastic diseases, such as choriocarcinoma, which is usually associated with pregnancy and a positive pregnancy test.\n   \n3. **Endometrial Cells**: These cells can lead to endometriosis, which often causes cyclic pelvic pain and may present with an adnexal mass, but it is usually not hypoechoic on ultrasonography.\n   \n4. **Stromal Cells**: These cells are part of the ovarian stroma and can give rise to stromal tumors such as granulosa cell tumors and thecomas. These tumors can present with symptoms related to hormone production, but they can also present as a simple adnexal mass.\n\n### Analyzing Symptoms and Findings:\n- The patient has irregular menstruation and a hypoechoic mass.\n- The weight loss and fever suggest a possible malignancy.\n- The dragging pelvic pain is consistent with an adnexal mass, but the irregular menses and the ultrasonographic finding of a hypoechoic mass suggest a stromal origin.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the combination of symptoms, the characteristics of the adnexal mass, and the patient's age, the mass is most likely derived from stromal cells, as these can present with such features and are common in this age group.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": "D"}
