{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?\nA. Germ cells\nB. Chorionic epithelial cells\nC. Endometrial cells\nD. Stromal cells\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cell type from which the adnexal mass is derived, let's analyze the information given.\n\n1. **Patient Characteristics and Symptoms:**\n   - The patient is a 31-year-old woman.\n   - She has irregular menses, with intervals of 30 to 45 days.\n   - Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago.\n   - She presents with fever (temperature 38\u00b0C), tachycardia (heart rate 102/min), and normal blood pressure (128/84 mm Hg).\n   - Physical examination reveals hyperreflexia.\n   - Urine pregnancy test is negative.\n   - Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass.\n\n2. **Differential Diagnosis for Adnexal Masses:**\n   - **Germ cell tumors**: These originate from the cells that produce eggs. Common examples include teratomas, dysgerminomas, and endodermal sinus tumors.\n   - **Chorionic epithelial cells**: These are associated with gestational trophoblastic diseases like hydatidiform moles and choriocarcinomas.\n   - **Endometrial cells**: These could suggest endometriosis or endometrioid tumors, which are derived from the lining of the uterus.\n   - **Stromal cells**: These are derived from the connective tissue of the ovary and include tumors like granulosa cell tumors and thecomas.\n\n3. **Clinical Clues:**\n   - The patient has hyperreflexia, which may be a clue pointing towards a hormonal imbalance or endocrine activity.\n   - The irregular menstrual cycle and hyperreflexia could suggest a functional ovarian mass like a granulosa cell tumor, which is a type of stromal tumor that can produce hormones and affect the menstrual cycle.\n\n4. **Ultrasound Findings:**\n   - A hypoechoic mass on ultrasound can be consistent with various types of ovarian masses, but stromal tumors often present this way.\n\nGiven these points, the most likely cell type from which this adnexal mass is derived is stromal cells, due to the combination of irregular menstrual cycles, hormonal symptoms (such as hyperreflexia), and the hypoechoic nature of the mass on ultrasound.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": "D"}
