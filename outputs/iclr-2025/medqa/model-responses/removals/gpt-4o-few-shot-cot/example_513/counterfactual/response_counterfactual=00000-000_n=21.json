{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?\nA. Germ cells\nB. Chorionic epithelial cells\nC. Endometrial cells\nD. Stromal cells\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely origin of the adnexal mass, let's analyze the information provided.\n\n1. **Patient's Symptoms and Signs:**\n   - Dragging pelvic pain\n   - Weight loss\n   - Irregular menstrual cycles\n   - Hyperreflexia\n\n2. **Diagnostic Findings:**\n   - Negative urine pregnancy test\n   - Ultrasonography showing a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Draggin Pelvic Pain:** This symptom can be associated with various types of adnexal masses, including those derived from germ cells, stromal cells, or endometrial cells.\n  \n- **Weight Loss:** This is a non-specific symptom but could be associated with a malignancy.\n  \n- **Irregular Menses:** This can be seen in the context of ovarian dysfunction, which may be related to the mass.\n  \n- **Hyperreflexia:** This is an interesting finding that can sometimes be associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, which might point to a specific type of tumor that has systemic effects.\n  \n- **Hypoechoic Adnexal Mass:** Hypoechoic masses on ultrasound can be seen in a variety of conditions, but certain characteristics can help narrow down the possibilities.\n\n### Potential Origins of the Mass:\n\n- **Germ Cells (A):** Germ cell tumors can present with pelvic pain and irregular menses. They are relatively common in younger women and can be associated with weight loss if malignant.\n\n- **Chorionic Epithelial Cells (B):** This option would typically be related to gestational trophoblastic disease, which is less likely given the negative pregnancy test and the patient's age and history.\n\n- **Endometrial Cells (C):** Endometriomas (chocolate cysts) are derived from endometrial cells and can cause pelvic pain and menstrual irregularities. However, they are usually associated with a different ultrasound appearance (often described as \"ground glass\" echogenicity).\n\n- **Stromal Cells (D):** Stromal cell tumors (sex cord-stromal tumors) can cause hormonal imbalances, leading to irregular menses and systemic effects like weight loss and hyperreflexia.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the combination of symptoms, the irregular menses, the significant weight loss, and the hypoechoic nature of the mass on ultrasound, a stromal cell origin is most consistent with the clinical picture. Stromal cell tumors, such as granulosa cell tumors, can produce hormones leading to systemic effects and irregular menstrual cycles.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": "D"}
