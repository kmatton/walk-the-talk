{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?\nA. Germ cells\nB. Chorionic epithelial cells\nC. Endometrial cells\nD. Stromal cells\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cell type from which the adnexal mass is derived, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and the characteristics of the mass found on ultrasonography. \n\n### Patient's Symptoms:\n- Dragging pelvic pain\n- Weight loss\n- Irregular menses\n- Hyperreflexia\n\n### Ultrasonography Findings:\n- 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass\n\n### Analysis of Cell Types:\n\n1. **Germ Cells:**\n   - Germ cell tumors are common in young women and can present with a variety of symptoms. They often produce hormones or tumor markers (AFP, hCG). However, the description does not specifically match typical germ cell tumor characteristics, such as rapid growth or specific tumor markers.\n\n2. **Chorionic Epithelial Cells:**\n   - These are associated with gestational trophoblastic disease, which often presents with abnormal bleeding and markedly elevated hCG levels. The patient's negative urine pregnancy test and lack of bleeding make this less likely.\n\n3. **Endometrial Cells:**\n   - Endometriosis can present with pelvic pain and irregular menses, but typically endometriomas (chocolate cysts) are described as complex cystic masses, not necessarily hypoechoic.\n\n4. **Stromal Cells:**\n   - Stromal cell tumors, such as sex cord-stromal tumors (e.g., granulosa cell tumors), can present with pelvic pain and hormonal symptoms. These tumors can also present as hypoechoic masses on ultrasonography and may cause hyperreflexia due to paraneoplastic syndromes or hormonal effects.\n\nGiven the combination of symptoms and ultrasonographic findings, stromal cell tumors are the most likely cause in this context.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAnswer: D", "answer": "D"}
