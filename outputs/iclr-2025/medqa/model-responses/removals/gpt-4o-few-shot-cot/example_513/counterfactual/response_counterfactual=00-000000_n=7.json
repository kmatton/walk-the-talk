{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?\nA. Germ cells\nB. Chorionic epithelial cells\nC. Endometrial cells\nD. Stromal cells\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Based on the information provided, let's analyze the case step-by-step to determine the most likely origin of the adnexal mass.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n1. **Patient History and Symptoms:**\n   - **Age**: 31-year-old woman.\n   - **Menstrual irregularity**: Menses occurring at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals.\n   - **Last menstrual period**: 5 weeks ago.\n   - **Symptoms**: Fever (38\u00b0C/100.4\u00b0F), tachycardia (heart rate 102/min), and hyperreflexia.\n\n2. **Physical Examination:**\n   - **Vital signs**: Elevated temperature and heart rate, normal blood pressure.\n   - **Notable finding**: Hyperreflexia, which can be associated with thyroid issues or other systemic conditions.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Tests:**\n   - **Urine pregnancy test**: Negative.\n   - **Ultrasonography**: Shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis:\n- The presence of a hypoechoic adnexal mass with irregular periods and systemic symptoms like fever and hyperreflexia can be indicative of certain types of ovarian tumors or masses.\n\n### Types of Adnexal Masses:\n1. **Germ cells (A)**: These tumors are derived from the cells that form eggs. Examples include teratomas and dysgerminomas.\n2. **Chorionic epithelial cells (B)**: These cells are related to gestational trophoblastic disease, which is unlikely given the negative pregnancy test.\n3. **Endometrial cells (C)**: These cells are associated with endometriosis, which typically forms endometriomas.\n4. **Stromal cells (D)**: These cells form the supportive tissue of the ovary and can give rise to stromal tumors, such as granulosa cell tumors.\n\n### Most Likely Diagnosis:\nGiven the patient's age, the characteristics of the mass, and the systemic symptoms, a stromal cell origin is most plausible. Stromal cell tumors, such as granulosa cell tumors, can cause hormonal imbalances that lead to irregular menses. Additionally, hyperreflexia can be connected to hormonal activity associated with these tumors.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe adnexal mass is most likely derived from stromal cells.\n\n**Answer: D**", "answer": "D"}
