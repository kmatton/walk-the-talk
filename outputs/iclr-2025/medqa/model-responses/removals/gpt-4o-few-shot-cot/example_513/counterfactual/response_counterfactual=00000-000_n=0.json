{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?\nA. Germ cells\nB. Chorionic epithelial cells\nC. Endometrial cells\nD. Stromal cells\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the type of cell most likely responsible for the adnexal mass in the given clinical scenario, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and findings:\n\n1. **Dragging pelvic pain**: This symptom can be associated with various pelvic pathologies, including ovarian masses.\n2. **Weight loss**: This can be a nonspecific sign, but in the context of an adnexal mass, it might suggest a neoplastic process.\n3. **Irregular menses**: This suggests a potential hormonal imbalance that could be related to certain types of ovarian tumors.\n4. **Hyperreflexia**: This can be associated with hypercalcemia, which is sometimes seen in certain ovarian tumors.\n5. **Negative urine pregnancy test**: Rules out pregnancy as the cause of the adnexal mass.\n6. **Ultrasonography showing a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass**: The characteristics of the mass on imaging can provide clues about its nature.\n\nGiven these findings, let's consider the options:\n\nA. **Germ cells**: Germ cell tumors are common in younger women and can present with a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain and weight loss. However, they often present with more acute symptoms and sometimes elevated tumor markers like AFP or HCG.\n\nB. **Chorionic epithelial cells**: These cells would be involved in gestational trophoblastic disease, which is commonly associated with pregnancy. Given the negative pregnancy test, this is less likely.\n\nC. **Endometrial cells**: Endometriosis can cause pelvic pain and irregular menses, but it is less likely to present as a large hypoechoic mass on ultrasound.\n\nD. **Stromal cells**: Ovarian stromal tumors, such as granulosa cell tumors, can present with hormonal changes leading to irregular menses and pelvic pain. They can also cause hypercalcemia, which might explain the hyperreflexia.\n\nConsidering the clinical presentation and the imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is an ovarian stromal tumor. These tumors can cause hormonal changes and present with symptoms like irregular menses, pelvic pain, and even hypercalcemia.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": "D"}
