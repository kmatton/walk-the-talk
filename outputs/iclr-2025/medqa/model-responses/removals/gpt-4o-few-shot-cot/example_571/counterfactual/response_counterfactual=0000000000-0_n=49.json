{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 41-year-old G3P1 woman presents with a sudden onset throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness. Patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. Her last two pregnancies ended with spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation. No significant family history. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109). GCS is 14/15. Physical examination shows 3+ deep tendon reflexes and increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities. A non-contrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the picture. Which of the following would be the next best diagnostic step in this patient?\nA. Mixing study\nB. INR\nC. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test\nD. Clot retraction study\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the next best diagnostic step for this patient, we need to analyze the clinical presentation and the findings on the CT scan.\n\n### Clinical Presentation:\n- **Headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness**: These symptoms suggest a neurological event.\n- **No significant medical history or medications**.\n- **Past pregnancies ending in spontaneous abortions**: This could be a clue towards a hypercoagulable state.\n- **Vital signs**: Mildly elevated blood pressure, normal pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature.\n- **Physical examination**: Shows hyperreflexia and increased muscle tone on the left side, which are signs of a central nervous system lesion.\n\n### CT Scan Findings:\nWithout the actual image, we assume that the CT scan shows findings consistent with a stroke, given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis:\nGiven the patient's history of spontaneous abortions and current neurological findings, an underlying coagulopathy or hypercoagulable state must be considered. This can include:\n- Antiphospholipid syndrome\n- Other clotting disorders\n\n### Diagnostic Steps:\nTo confirm a hypercoagulable state, specific tests are required. Here are the options provided:\n- **A. Mixing study**: This is used to distinguish between a factor deficiency and an inhibitor in patients with prolonged clotting times.\n- **B. INR**: This measures the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, but by itself, it might not be sufficient to diagnose the specific condition associated with recurrent miscarriages and possible stroke.\n- **C. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test**: This test is used primarily to diagnose von Willebrand disease, which does not typically present with these symptoms.\n- **D. Clot retraction study**: This is rarely used in modern practice and typically measures platelet function.\n\nGiven the clinical context, a mixing study would be appropriate to identify an underlying coagulopathy, especially if considering antiphospholipid syndrome, which can present with both recurrent miscarriages and thrombotic events.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most appropriate next diagnostic step in this patient is:\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
