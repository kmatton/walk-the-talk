{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 41-year-old woman presents with a sudden onset throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness. Patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. No significant family history. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109). GCS is 14/15. Physical examination shows 3+ deep tendon reflexes and increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Platelet count 230,000/mm3 Fibrinogen 3.5 g/L Activated partial thromboplastin time  70 s Thrombin time 34 s  A non-contrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the picture. Which of the following would be the next best diagnostic step in this patient?\nA. Mixing study\nB. INR\nC. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test\nD. Clot retraction study\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings of the patient, let's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with a sudden onset of throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness. These symptoms suggest a neurological event such as a stroke.\n\n2. **Vital Signs and Physical Examination**: \n   - Blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, which is mildly elevated but not critically high.\n   - Pulse is 58/min, which is on the lower side.\n   - Respiratory rate is 11/min, which is within the normal range.\n   - Temperature is 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109), which is normal.\n   - GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) is 14/15, indicating mild neurological impairment.\n   - Physical exam reveals 3+ deep tendon reflexes and increased muscle tone on the left side, suggesting an upper motor neuron lesion.\n\n3. **Laboratory Findings**:\n   - Platelet count: 230,000/mm\u00b3 (normal).\n   - Fibrinogen: 3.5 g/L (normal).\n   - Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): 70 s (prolonged; normal range is typically around 25-35 s).\n   - Thrombin time (TT): 34 s (prolonged; normal range is typically around 14-21 s).\n\n4. **CT Findings**: Non-contrast CT of the head shows evidence of a potential hemorrhagic or ischemic event. The exact nature isn't specified, but prolonged aPTT and thrombin time suggest a bleeding disorder.\n\nGiven the prolonged aPTT and thrombin time, the next best diagnostic step would be to perform a **Mixing Study**. This test helps determine whether the prolonged aPTT is due to a factor deficiency or an inhibitor (such as lupus anticoagulant or an acquired inhibitor).\n\n- **Mixing Study** (A) involves mixing the patient's plasma with normal plasma to see if the aPTT corrects. If it corrects, this suggests a factor deficiency. If it does not correct, this suggests the presence of an inhibitor.\n- **INR** (B) measures the extrinsic pathway and is used primarily for monitoring warfarin therapy.\n- **Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test** (C) is used to diagnose von Willebrand disease and certain platelet function disorders but is less relevant here.\n- **Clot retraction study** (D) is rarely used and is more relevant for platelet function evaluation.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings, the prolonged aPTT and thrombin time indicate a potential coagulation pathway issue, making the Mixing Study the most appropriate next diagnostic step.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
