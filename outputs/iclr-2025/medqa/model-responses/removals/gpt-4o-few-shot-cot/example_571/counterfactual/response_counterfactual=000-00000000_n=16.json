{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 41-year-old G3P1 woman presents with unknown symptoms. Patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. Her last two pregnancies ended with spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation. No significant family history. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109). GCS is 14/15. Physical examination shows 3+ deep tendon reflexes and increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Platelet count 230,000/mm3 Fibrinogen 3.5 g/L Activated partial thromboplastin time  70 s Thrombin time 34 s  A non-contrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the picture. Which of the following would be the next best diagnostic step in this patient?\nA. Mixing study\nB. INR\nC. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test\nD. Clot retraction study\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, let's analyze the provided information step-by-step with clinical reasoning:\n\n### Patient History and Symptoms:\n1. **Age and Gender**: 41-year-old G3P1 woman \n2. **Obstetric history**: Two spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation.\n3. **Vital signs**: Blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 11/min, temperature 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109).\n4. **Neurological findings**: GCS is 14/15, 3+ deep tendon reflexes, increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities.\n5. **Laboratory findings**:\n   - Platelet count: 230,000/mm\u00b3 (normal)\n   - Fibrinogen: 3.5 g/L (normal or mildly elevated)\n   - Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): 70 s (prolonged)\n   - Thrombin time: 34 s (prolonged)\n\n### CT Scan:\n- The question mentions a non-contrast CT of the head but does not provide details about the findings. However, given the neurological symptoms, it is likely the CT may show signs consistent with a cerebral event, possibly a thrombotic stroke or other vascular pathology.\n\n### Analysis of Laboratory Findings:\n- **aPTT Prolongation**: The prolonged aPTT suggests a possible issue with the intrinsic or common coagulation pathways.\n- **Thrombin Time Prolongation**: This indicates a problem with the final step of the coagulation cascade, possibly due to an inhibitor or deficiency affecting thrombin function.\n\n### Obstetric History:\n- Recurrent early spontaneous abortions raise the suspicion of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is often associated with prolonged aPTT due to the presence of lupus anticoagulant.\n\n### Next Diagnostic Step:\n- **A. Mixing Study**: This is the most appropriate next step. It helps differentiate between a factor deficiency and the presence of an inhibitor (e.g., lupus anticoagulant). If the prolonged aPTT corrects with a mixing study, it suggests a factor deficiency. If it does not correct, it suggests the presence of an inhibitor.\n- **B. INR**: This test measures the extrinsic pathway (prothrombin time) and is not directly relevant given the prolonged aPTT.\n- **C. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test**: This test is used for diagnosing von Willebrand disease and is not relevant here.\n- **D. Clot retraction study**: This is not relevant to the findings presented.\n\nGiven the suspicion of antiphospholipid syndrome due to the history of recurrent miscarriages and prolonged aPTT, the correct next step is a mixing study.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
