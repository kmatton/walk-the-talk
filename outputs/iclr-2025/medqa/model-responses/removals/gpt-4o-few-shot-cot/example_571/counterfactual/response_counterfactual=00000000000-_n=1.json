{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 41-year-old G3P1 woman presents with a sudden onset throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness. Patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. Her last two pregnancies ended with spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation. No significant family history. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109). GCS is 14/15. Physical examination shows 3+ deep tendon reflexes and increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Platelet count 230,000/mm3 Fibrinogen 3.5 g/L Activated partial thromboplastin time  70 s Thrombin time 34 s. Which of the following would be the next best diagnostic step in this patient?\nA. Mixing study\nB. INR\nC. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test\nD. Clot retraction study\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question step-by-step, we need to consider the clinical presentation and the laboratory findings.\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation:**\n   - The patient has a sudden onset throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness. This suggests a possible cerebrovascular event.\n   - She has a history of two spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation.\n   - The physical examination shows increased deep tendon reflexes and muscle tone on the left side, supporting a neurological issue on the right side of the brain.\n   - Her vital signs are relatively stable, but the GCS is slightly decreased (14/15).\n\n2. **Laboratory Findings:**\n   - Platelet count is normal (230,000/mm\u00b3).\n   - Fibrinogen level is within the normal range (3.5 g/L).\n   - Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is significantly prolonged (70 s).\n   - Thrombin time is slightly prolonged (34 s).\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The prolonged aPTT in the absence of an abnormal platelet count or fibrinogen level suggests an issue with the intrinsic coagulation pathway.\n   - Given the history of recurrent pregnancy loss and the prolonged aPTT, one should consider an underlying coagulopathy, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).\n\n4. **Next Best Diagnostic Step:**\n   - A mixing study is used to differentiate between a factor deficiency and the presence of an inhibitor (like lupus anticoagulant) when the aPTT is prolonged.\n   - The mixing study involves mixing the patient's plasma with normal plasma and then measuring the aPTT again. If the aPTT corrects, it suggests a factor deficiency. If it does not correct, it suggests the presence of an inhibitor.\n\nGiven the combination of neurological symptoms, history of spontaneous abortions, and prolonged aPTT, the next best diagnostic step is to perform a mixing study to evaluate for the presence of an inhibitor, such as lupus anticoagulant, which is commonly seen in APS.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
