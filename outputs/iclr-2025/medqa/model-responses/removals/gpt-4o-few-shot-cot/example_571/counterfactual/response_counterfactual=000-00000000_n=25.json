{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 41-year-old G3P1 woman presents with unknown symptoms. Patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. Her last two pregnancies ended with spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation. No significant family history. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109). GCS is 14/15. Physical examination shows 3+ deep tendon reflexes and increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Platelet count 230,000/mm3 Fibrinogen 3.5 g/L Activated partial thromboplastin time  70 s Thrombin time 34 s  A non-contrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the picture. Which of the following would be the next best diagnostic step in this patient?\nA. Mixing study\nB. INR\nC. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test\nD. Clot retraction study\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To properly address this question, we need to interpret the clinical and laboratory findings and correlate them with possible conditions.\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**:\n   - The patient has had multiple spontaneous abortions.\n   - Physical examination shows increased muscle tone and hyperreflexia on one side, which could indicate a neurological issue.\n   - The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is slightly decreased (14/15), indicating mild impairment of consciousness.\n\n2. **Laboratory Findings**:\n   - Platelet count: 230,000/mm\u00b3 (within normal range).\n   - Fibrinogen: 3.5 g/L (within normal range).\n   - Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): 70 s (prolonged, normal range typically around 30-40 seconds).\n   - Thrombin time: 34 s (prolonged, normal range typically around 14-19 seconds).\n\nGiven the prolonged aPTT and thrombin time with a normal platelet count and fibrinogen, one condition to consider is the presence of a lupus anticoagulant, which is often associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS can lead to recurrent miscarriages and thrombotic events, which might explain the neurological symptoms.\n\n3. **Next Diagnostic Step**:\n   - **A. Mixing study**: This test can determine whether the prolonged aPTT is due to a factor deficiency or an inhibitor (such as a lupus anticoagulant).\n   - **B. INR**: This is used to measure the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, primarily to monitor warfarin therapy; it is not directly relevant to the current findings.\n   - **C. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test**: This is used to diagnose von Willebrand disease or Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which do not fit the clinical picture here.\n   - **D. Clot retraction study**: This test is used to evaluate platelet function but is not typically relevant to prolonged aPTT or thrombin time.\n\nGiven the findings, a **Mixing study** (A) is the appropriate next step as it will help differentiate between a factor deficiency and an inhibitor like a lupus anticoagulant.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
