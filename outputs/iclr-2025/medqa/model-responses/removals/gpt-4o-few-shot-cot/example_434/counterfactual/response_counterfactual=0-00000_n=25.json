{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over the left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?\nA. Ulnar artery\nB. Flexor pollicis longus tendon\nC. Flexor carpi radialis tendon\nD. Ulnar nerve\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To analyze this question, let's break down the information provided and correlate it with anatomical knowledge.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Painless lump near left wrist**: Typically, a painless lump that transilluminates is often a ganglion cyst.\n2. **Tingling pain over the left hand**: Indicates possible nerve involvement.\n3. **Transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass**: This description is consistent with a ganglion cyst.\n4. **Decreased sensation to pinprick on thumb, index, middle, and radial half of ring finger**: These areas are innervated by the median nerve.\n5. **Tingling pain aggravated by tapping over the swelling**: This is suggestive of Tinel's sign, indicating nerve irritation.\n\n### Anatomical Correlation:\n- The **median nerve** passes through the carpal tunnel at the wrist, which is located on the volar (palm) side of the hand.\n- A ganglion cyst in this area can cause compression of the median nerve, leading to decreased sensation in the areas mentioned.\n\n### Options Analysis:\n- **A. Ulnar artery**: The ulnar artery runs along the medial aspect of the forearm and wrist, not typically affected in this scenario.\n- **B. Flexor pollicis longus tendon**: This tendon is on the volar side but isn\u2019t directly associated with the sensory symptoms described.\n- **C. Flexor carpi radialis tendon**: This tendon is also on the volar side but again isn\u2019t directly related to sensory symptoms.\n- **D. Ulnar nerve**: This nerve innervates the ulnar side of the hand, including the little finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger, which doesn't match the sensory distribution described.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the symptoms of decreased sensation in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger, and the anatomical location of the ganglion cyst, the structure at risk of entrapment is the **median nerve**. However, the median nerve is not listed as an option, so the correct focus should be on structures closely related to this area. The flexor carpi radialis tendon is adjacent to the median nerve and could be related to the entrapment affecting the nerve.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
