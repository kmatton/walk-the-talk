{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?\nA. Ulnar artery\nB. Flexor pollicis longus tendon\nC. Flexor carpi radialis tendon\nD. Ulnar nerve\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Based on the provided information and considering the clinical presentation, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1. **Physical Examination Findings:**\n   - **Transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass:** This description is consistent with a ganglion cyst, which can occur near the wrist.\n   - **Decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger:** This sensory distribution corresponds to the median nerve.\n   - **Tingling pain aggravated by tapping over the swelling (Tinel's sign):** This suggests irritation or involvement of the median nerve.\n\n2. **Anatomical Considerations:**\n   - The **median nerve** is responsible for sensation in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger. Entrapment of this nerve can lead to the sensory symptoms described.\n   - The **ulnar nerve** typically affects the little finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger, so it is less likely involved here.\n   - The **ulnar artery** and tendons like the **flexor pollicis longus** and **flexor carpi radialis** are in close proximity but are not directly associated with the described sensory changes.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the sensory distribution and positive Tinel's sign, the most likely adjacent structure at risk of entrapment by the mass is the **median nerve**.\n   \nHowever, since the question specifically asks about the adjacent structures listed (ulnar artery, flexor pollicis longus tendon, flexor carpi radialis tendon, ulnar nerve) and none of these directly match the median nerve, we need to infer the most relevant option that would align with the physical findings and potential complications.\n\nConsidering the location and typical anatomical relationships:\n   - **Flexor pollicis longus tendon** runs in close proximity to the median nerve.\n   - The other options (ulnar artery, flexor carpi radialis tendon, ulnar nerve) are less likely to be directly involved in the sensory distribution described.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate adjacent structure at risk of entrapment, based on the given choices, is:\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
