{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?\nA. Ulnar artery\nB. Flexor pollicis longus tendon\nC. Flexor carpi radialis tendon\nD. Ulnar nerve\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine which adjacent structure is at risk of entrapment if the mass persists, let's review the clinical details and anatomical relationships:\n\n1. **Location and Characteristics of the Mass**:\n   - The mass is described as transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, and non-tender.\n   - It is located over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist.\n\n2. **Symptoms**:\n   - The patient reports tingling pain over the left hand.\n   - There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger.\n\n3. **Anatomical Considerations**:\n   - The radial side of the wrist, where the mass is located, primarily involves the median nerve, which supplies sensation to the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger.\n   - The ulnar nerve primarily affects the little finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger.\n   - The flexor pollicis longus tendon and the flexor carpi radialis tendon are also located in the volar aspect of the wrist but would not typically cause the described sensory deficits.\n   - The ulnar artery does not typically cause sensory deficits in the distribution described.\n\nGiven the sensory distribution described (thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger), the most likely structure at risk of entrapment is the **median nerve**.\n\nHowever, the median nerve is not listed as an option. Given the anatomical location and the options provided, the structure most likely at risk, considering the anatomical pathway and the clinical presentation, is:\n\n**Answer: C (Flexor carpi radialis tendon)**\n\nThis is because the flexor carpi radialis tendon is closely associated with the median nerve in the volar aspect of the wrist, and entrapment or compression in this area can affect the median nerve, resulting in the described sensory deficits.", "answer": "C"}
