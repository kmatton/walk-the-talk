{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over the left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?\nA. Ulnar artery\nB. Flexor pollicis longus tendon\nC. Flexor carpi radialis tendon\nD. Ulnar nerve\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this case, we need to analyze the symptoms and physical findings and correlate them with the anatomical structures in the region.\n\n1. **Painless Lump Near the Left Wrist**: This likely indicates a cyst or benign growth, such as a ganglion cyst, which is common in this region.\n\n2. **Tingling Pain Over the Left Hand**: This suggests nerve involvement, specifically the median nerve, which provides sensation to the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger.\n\n3. **Transilluminating, Rubbery, Fixed, Non-tender Mass**: These are characteristic features of a ganglion cyst, which commonly occurs on the dorsal or volar aspect of the wrist.\n\n4. **Decreased Sensation in Specific Fingers**: This pattern of sensory loss (thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring finger) is typical for median nerve compression.\n\n5. **Tingling Pain Aggravated by Tapping Over the Swelling**: This is indicative of Tinel's sign, which is positive in cases of nerve compression.\n\n### Adjacent Structures Analysis:\n\n- **Ulnar Artery**: This artery runs on the ulnar side of the forearm and hand, not typically affected by masses on the lateral volar aspect of the wrist.\n\n- **Flexor Pollicis Longus Tendon**: This tendon runs deep in the forearm and wrist and is not typically superficial enough to be involved in the described superficial mass.\n\n- **Flexor Carpi Radialis Tendon**: This tendon is located on the volar (anterior) aspect of the wrist, closer to the region of the described mass, but it is not directly responsible for the sensory distribution described.\n\n- **Ulnar Nerve**: This nerve provides sensation to the little finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger, not the thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring finger.\n\nGiven the sensory distribution of the symptoms and the location of the mass, the most likely structure at risk of entrapment is the **median nerve**. However, the options provided do not include the median nerve but focus on anatomical structures nearby. The correct structure impacted by the entrapment of the median nerve is implied by exclusion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the physical findings and the anatomical considerations, the structure at risk if the mass persists is the **flexor carpi radialis tendon** due to its proximity to the median nerve.\n\n**Answer: C**", "answer": "C"}
