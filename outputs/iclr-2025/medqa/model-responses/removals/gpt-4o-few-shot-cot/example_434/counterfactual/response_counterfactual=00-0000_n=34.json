{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?\nA. Ulnar artery\nB. Flexor pollicis longus tendon\nC. Flexor carpi radialis tendon\nD. Ulnar nerve\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To accurately determine which adjacent structure is at risk of entrapment due to the described mass, let's review the clinical presentation and relevant anatomical details:\n\n1. **Painless Lump and Transillumination**:\n   - The lump is described as transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, and non-tender, which is consistent with a ganglion cyst. Ganglion cysts are common benign masses that typically occur near joints or tendons, often around the wrist.\n\n2. **Location of the Mass**:\n   - The mass is located over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. This anatomical region is where ganglion cysts frequently occur.\n\n3. **Neurological Symptoms**:\n   - The patient has decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger. These areas are innervated by the median nerve.\n   - Tapping over the swelling aggravates the tingling pain, which is indicative of Tinel's sign. This sign suggests nerve involvement, likely the median nerve, which passes through the carpal tunnel at the wrist.\n\nGiven these points, the median nerve is at risk of entrapment if the ganglion cyst persists. However, since the question asks for an adjacent structure at risk of entrapment and the median nerve is not an option, we need to consider related structures:\n\n- **Ulnar Artery**: Located more medially, not typically associated with lateral volar wrist masses.\n- **Flexor Pollicis Longus Tendon**: Runs more centrally in the wrist but is not typically associated with lateral volar masses.\n- **Flexor Carpi Radialis Tendon**: This tendon runs near the region described and could be affected by a lateral volar mass.\n- **Ulnar Nerve**: Located on the medial side of the wrist, not typically involved in lateral volar masses.\n\nConsidering the anatomical location and typical involvement, the **Flexor Carpi Radialis Tendon** is the most likely adjacent structure at risk of entrapment by a ganglion cyst in the described location.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
