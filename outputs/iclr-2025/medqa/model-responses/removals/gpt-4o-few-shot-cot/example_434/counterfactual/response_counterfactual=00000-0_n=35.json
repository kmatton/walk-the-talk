{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?\nA. Ulnar artery\nB. Flexor pollicis longus tendon\nC. Flexor carpi radialis tendon\nD. Ulnar nerve\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To address this question, let's analyze the clinical presentation and the anatomical structures involved:\n\n1. **Location of the mass**: The mass is located on the lateral volar (palmar) aspect of the left wrist.\n2. **Characteristics of the mass**: It is a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass. This description is consistent with a ganglion cyst, which is a common cause of such symptoms.\n3. **Symptoms of entrapment**: The patient experiences tingling pain over the left hand that worsens with tapping over the swelling (positive Tinel's sign), indicating nerve involvement.\n\nGiven the mass's location and the tingling pain, we need to determine which structure is most likely at risk of entrapment:\n\n- **Ulnar artery**: This artery runs along the medial side of the wrist, not the lateral side.\n- **Flexor pollicis longus tendon**: This tendon is located more centrally and towards the radial side but does not typically cause tingling pain when compressed.\n- **Flexor carpi radialis tendon**: This tendon is found on the radial side of the wrist but does not typically cause tingling pain.\n- **Ulnar nerve**: This nerve runs along the medial side of the wrist and hand, supplying sensation to the ring and little fingers and the palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand.\n\nGiven that the mass is on the lateral volar aspect of the wrist, the most likely structure at risk of entrapment is **not** the ulnar nerve, as it is located medially. \n\nInstead, considering the proximity and typical presentation of a ganglion cyst on the lateral volar wrist, the **median nerve** is more likely to be implicated. However, the median nerve is not listed as an option.\n\nThus, the correct response among the provided options would be:\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
