{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?\nA. Ulnar artery\nB. Flexor pollicis longus tendon\nC. Flexor carpi radialis tendon\nD. Ulnar nerve\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine which adjacent structure is at risk of entrapment given the symptoms and physical findings, we need to consider the anatomical location and the distribution of the sensory symptoms.\n\n1. **Symptoms and Examination Findings:**\n   - Painless lump near the left wrist.\n   - Tingling pain over the left hand.\n   - Transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist.\n   - Decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger.\n   - Tingling pain aggravated by tapping over the swelling (Tinel's sign).\n\n2. **Anatomical Considerations:**\n   - The lateral volar aspect of the wrist is where the carpal tunnel is located.\n   - The median nerve passes through the carpal tunnel and provides sensation to the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger.\n   - The presence of a mass in this area could compress the median nerve, leading to the described sensory symptoms.\n\n3. **Analysis of Options:**\n   - **A. Ulnar artery:** The ulnar artery runs on the medial side of the wrist and is not typically associated with the symptoms described.\n   - **B. Flexor pollicis longus tendon:** This tendon runs through the carpal tunnel but is not responsible for the sensory symptoms described.\n   - **C. Flexor carpi radialis tendon:** This tendon is located more laterally and does not pass through the carpal tunnel.\n   - **D. Ulnar nerve:** The ulnar nerve runs on the medial side of the wrist and innervates the little finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger, which does not match the sensory distribution described.\n\nGiven the location of the mass and the sensory symptoms, it is most likely that the median nerve is at risk of entrapment.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
