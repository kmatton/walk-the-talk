{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus.

Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 32-year-old woman presents to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, has a poor appetite, and has had a problem concentrating for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also has had low energy and has lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Her physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should be avoided in this patient?\nA. Bupropion\nB. Citalopram\nC. Fluoxetine\nD. Trazodone\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most appropriate treatment for this patient and which drug should be avoided, we need to consider her symptoms and the characteristics of the medications listed.\n\nThe patient has symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD), including depression, difficulty sleeping, poor appetite, poor concentration, low energy, and loss of interest in activities. The medications listed are commonly used to treat MDD, but each has different properties that may or may not be suitable for this patient.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. **Bupropion:** This medication is known for its stimulating effects and is less likely to cause sexual side effects or weight gain compared to other antidepressants. However, bupropion can lower the seizure threshold and is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure disorders or eating disorders. There is no mention of these conditions in the patient's history. However, bupropion is stimulating and may exacerbate her difficulty sleeping.\n\nB. **Citalopram:** This is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used to treat depression and anxiety. It is generally well-tolerated but can cause side effects such as sexual dysfunction and gastrointestinal issues. It is not particularly sedating or stimulating, so it might be a reasonable choice.\n\nC. **Fluoxetine:** Another SSRI, fluoxetine is known for its activating properties, which can be beneficial for patients with low energy. However, it may also cause insomnia or exacerbate sleep difficulties, which is a concern for this patient.\n\nD. **Trazodone:** This medication is an atypical antidepressant with sedative properties. It is often used off-label to treat insomnia due to its calming effects. It would likely help with the patient's difficulty sleeping, making it a potentially good option for her.\n\nGiven that the patient has significant difficulty sleeping, **bupropion** and **fluoxetine** (which can be stimulating) may not be ideal choices. **Trazodone** would help with sleep, and **citalopram** is a neutral option regarding sleep.\n\nSince we need to identify the drug that should be avoided:\n- **Fluoxetine** and **bupropion** are stimulating and can worsen insomnia.\n- Between these, **bupropion** is more directly contraindicated due to its stimulating effects and potential to worsen sleep issues.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
