It is generally avoided in patients with a history of eating disorders or conditions that predispose them to seizures.\n\n2. **Citalopram**: This is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used to treat depression and is not contraindicated based on the patient's history.\n\n3. **Fluoxetine**: Another SSRI, which is also a common treatment for depression and is not contraindicated in this patient.\n\n4. **Trazodone**: This medication is typically used for depression and insomnia. However, it is not contraindicated based on the patient\u2019s history.\n\nGiven that the patient has had similar depressive episodes and there is no evidence of suicidal ideation, **Bupropion** should be avoided due to its potential to lower the seizure threshold and its stimulating properties that might not be suitable for a patient with sleep difficulties.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
