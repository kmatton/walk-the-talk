Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Given the patient's history of binge eating and purging behavior, which suggests a history of bulimia nervosa, certain medications should be avoided due to the risk of exacerbating these behaviors or causing adverse effects.\n\n- **Bupropion** (A) is contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders like bulimia nervosa because it lowers the seizure threshold and increases the risk of seizures, which is particularly concerning in patients who may have electrolyte imbalances from purging.\n- **Citalopram** (B) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and is generally considered safe for treating depression in patients with a history of eating disorders.\n- **Fluoxetine** (C) is another SSRI that is actually approved for the treatment of bulimia nervosa and is considered safe and effective for this population.\n- **Trazodone** (D) is an antidepressant that is often used for its sedative effects to help with sleep issues, but it does not have the specific contraindications that bupropion has for patients with bulimia nervosa.\n\nGiven these considerations, the medication that should be avoided in this patient is:\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
