Trazodone\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, we must consider the patient's current symptoms and past medical history. The patient's current symptoms suggest a depressive episode, but her history of binge eating and purging during high school is crucial to consider when choosing an appropriate medication.\n\n1. **Bupropion**: This medication is an atypical antidepressant that inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. It is also known to lower the seizure threshold, which can be problematic for patients with a history of eating disorders, as they are at a higher risk for seizures.\n  \n2. **Citalopram**: This is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used to treat depression. It generally has a favorable safety profile and does not lower the seizure threshold significantly.\n\n3. **Fluoxetine**: Another SSRI, it is also commonly used to treat depression and has been shown to be effective in treating bulimia nervosa, making it a generally safe option for patients with a history of eating disorders.\n\n4. **Trazodone**: This medication is primarily used for its sedative effects to treat insomnia, but it also has antidepressant properties. It does not significantly lower the seizure threshold.\n\nGiven the patient's history of binge eating and purging, **bupropion** should be avoided due to its potential to lower the seizure threshold, which can be particularly dangerous for individuals with a history of eating disorders.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
