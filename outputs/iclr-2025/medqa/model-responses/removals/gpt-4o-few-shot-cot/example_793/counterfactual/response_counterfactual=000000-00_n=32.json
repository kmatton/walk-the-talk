Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion.

During this time, she has also has had low energy and has lost interest in playing the guitar.

Her physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should be avoided in this patient?\nA. Bupropion\nB. Citalopram\nC. Fluoxetine\nD. Trazodone\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, we need to consider the side effect profiles and contraindications of each of the medications listed:\n\nA. Bupropion: Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that is known to lower the seizure threshold. It is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures or eating disorders, and it can also exacerbate anxiety and insomnia.\n\nB. Citalopram: Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) which is generally well-tolerated and considered a first-line treatment for depression. It does not have significant side effects that would specifically contraindicate its use in this patient.\n\nC. Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine is another SSRI that is also commonly used to treat depression. Like Citalopram, it is generally safe and effective for most patients.\n\nD. Trazodone: Trazodone is an antidepressant with sedative properties, often used for patients with insomnia. While it can be useful for patients with sleep disturbances, it is less effective as a primary treatment for depression and is often used as an adjunct.\n\nGiven the patient's history of difficulty sleeping and poor appetite, Trazodone could potentially address the sleep issues. Citalopram and Fluoxetine are both SSRIs and are appropriate for treating depression without the specific contraindications present in this case.\n\nHowever, Bupropion's side effects, particularly its potential to exacerbate insomnia and anxiety, make it the least suitable option for this patient who is already experiencing difficulty sleeping. Therefore, Bupropion should be avoided.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
