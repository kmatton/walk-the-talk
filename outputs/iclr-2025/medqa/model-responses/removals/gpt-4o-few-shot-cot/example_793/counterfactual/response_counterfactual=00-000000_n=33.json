This suggests a possible history of bulimia nervosa. \n\n1. **Bupropion**: This medication is an atypical antidepressant that is contraindicated in patients with eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa because it lowers the seizure threshold and increases the risk of seizures, which is particularly dangerous in individuals with a history of binge eating and purging.\n\n2. **Citalopram**: This is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat depression and anxiety. It is generally safe and does not have specific contraindications related to eating disorders.\n\n3. **Fluoxetine**: Another SSRI, which is actually FDA-approved for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. It is considered safe and effective for individuals with this condition.\n\n4. **Trazodone**: This is primarily used as an antidepressant and sedative. It does not have specific contraindications related to eating disorders but is more commonly used for its sedative properties.\n\nGiven the patient's past history of binge eating and purging, the use of Bupropion should be avoided due to its increased risk of seizures in these patients.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
