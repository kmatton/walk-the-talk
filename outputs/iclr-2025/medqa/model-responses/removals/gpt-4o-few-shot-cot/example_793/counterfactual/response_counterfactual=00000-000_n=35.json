Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions.

During this time, she has also has had low energy and has lost interest in playing the guitar.

Her physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should be avoided in this patient?\nA. Bupropion\nB. Citalopram\nC. Fluoxetine\nD. Trazodone\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "The patient presents with symptoms of depression, including difficulty sleeping, poor appetite, problems concentrating, low energy, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities. Additionally, the patient has a history of binge eating and purging behavior, which suggests a possible eating disorder.\n\nLet's analyze each medication option:\n\nA. **Bupropion**: Bupropion is an antidepressant that works by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. It is known to lower the seizure threshold, making it potentially unsafe for patients with eating disorders (especially those involving purging) due to the increased risk of seizures.\n\nB. **Citalopram**: Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is generally safe and effective for treating depression and anxiety disorders. It does not have a significant risk of lowering the seizure threshold.\n\nC. **Fluoxetine**: Fluoxetine is another SSRI that is commonly used to treat depression and is also approved for treating bulimia nervosa, a type of eating disorder. It does not have a significant risk of lowering the seizure threshold.\n\nD. **Trazodone**: Trazodone is an antidepressant that is often used for its sedative properties to help with sleep disturbances. It does not significantly lower the seizure threshold and is generally considered safe for patients with depression and sleep difficulties.\n\nGiven the patient's history of binge eating and purging behavior, **bupropion** should be avoided due to its potential to lower the seizure threshold and increase the risk of seizures in this population.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
