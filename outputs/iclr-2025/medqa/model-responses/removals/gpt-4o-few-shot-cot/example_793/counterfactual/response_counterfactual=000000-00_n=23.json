{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 32-year-old woman presents to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, has a poor appetite, and has had a problem concentrating for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also has had low energy and has lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Her physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should be avoided in this patient?\nA. Bupropion\nB. Citalopram\nC. Fluoxetine\nD. Trazodone\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the appropriate medication to avoid in this patient, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and the potential side effects of each drug.\n\n- **Bupropion**: This medication is an atypical antidepressant that primarily affects norepinephrine and dopamine. It is generally stimulating and can be helpful for patients with low energy and concentration issues. However, it is known to lower the seizure threshold and should be avoided in patients with a history of seizures or eating disorders. There is no indication in the patient's history of such conditions.\n  \n- **Citalopram**: This is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that increases serotonin levels. It is generally well-tolerated and effective for depression and anxiety. There are no specific contraindications based on the patient's history.\n\n- **Fluoxetine**: Another SSRI, similar to citalopram, it is often used for depression and anxiety. It has a longer half-life than citalopram and can be activating, which might be beneficial for low energy. There are no specific contraindications based on the patient's history.\n\n- **Trazodone**: This is an antidepressant that primarily affects serotonin levels but is also used for its sedative effects. It is often used to help with sleep problems. Given the patient's history of difficulty sleeping, this medication might seem appropriate. However, trazodone can lead to significant sedation, which may not be ideal for someone experiencing low energy and poor concentration during the day.\n\nGiven that the patient has a history of low mood and poor sleep, **Trazodone** is seemingly a suitable choice. However, the patient's main symptoms now include low energy and poor concentration, making a sedative drug like trazodone less appropriate. On the other hand, **Bupropion** has a risk of lowering the seizure threshold and should be avoided in patients with seizure history or eating disorders, neither of which is indicated here. \n\nTherefore, the most likely drug to avoid in this patient, considering her current symptoms and the potential side effects, would be **Bupropion** due to its stimulating properties which could exacerbate anxiety or cause agitation in some patients with a history of mood disorders.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
