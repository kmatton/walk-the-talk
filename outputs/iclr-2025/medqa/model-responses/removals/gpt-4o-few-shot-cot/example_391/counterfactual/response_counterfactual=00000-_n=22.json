{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 62-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency room with severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea. Which of this patient's coronary arteries is most likely occluded?\nA. Left circumflex\nB. Diagonal perforators\nC. Septal perforators\nD. Right main\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely occluded coronary artery, we need to consider the clinical presentation of the patient with severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea. These symptoms are indicative of an acute coronary syndrome, often due to myocardial infarction (MI). The specific artery involved can be inferred based on common patterns of occlusion and the distribution of symptoms.\n\n1. **Left circumflex artery (A)**: The left circumflex artery supplies blood to the lateral and posterior parts of the left ventricle. Occlusion here typically causes lateral or sometimes posterior MI, which may not be accompanied by the classic substernal chest pain pattern, but rather pain that could radiate to the left shoulder or back.\n\n2. **Diagonal perforators (B)**: These are branches off the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. While occlusion here can cause anterior MI, it is generally less common as the primary site of occlusion compared to the main LAD itself.\n\n3. **Septal perforators (C)**: These are also branches off the LAD artery, supplying the interventricular septum. Occlusion here would also typically result in an anterior MI, but again, the main LAD artery is more commonly involved in significant MIs.\n\n4. **Right main coronary artery (D)**: The right coronary artery (RCA) supplies blood to the right ventricle, inferior wall of the left ventricle, and often the posterior part of the left ventricle. Occlusion of the RCA is commonly associated with inferior MI, which can often present with severe substernal chest pain, nausea, and diaphoresis, particularly due to involvement of the inferior wall.\n\nGiven the classic presentation of severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea, the most likely occluded artery in this scenario is the **right main coronary artery (RCA)**, which typically presents with these symptoms due to inferior MI.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": "D"}
