{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 60-year-old comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. They live in a group home and take no medications. During the appointment, they frequently repeat the same information and need to be reminded why they are at the doctor's office. They say that they are a famous poet and recently had a poem published in a national magazine. Their vital signs are within normal limits. They have a constricted affect. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, they have no long-term memory deficits and are able to count in serial sevens without error. An MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Consumption of undercooked meat\nB. Chronic hypertension\nC. Alcohol use disorder\nD. Spirochete infection\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition, let's analyze the clinical presentation and imaging findings.\n\n1. **Symptoms**: \n   - The patient frequently repeats the same information and needs reminders, indicating short-term memory impairment but retains long-term memory.\n   - They exhibit confabulation (claiming to be a famous poet).\n   - They have a constricted affect.\n   - No focal neurological deficits are present.\n\n2. **Imaging**: \n   - MRI shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mammillary bodies.\n\n3. **Possible Conditions**:\n   - **Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome**: This is a condition commonly associated with chronic alcohol use disorder. It results from a deficiency in thiamine (vitamin B1) and can lead to atrophy of the mammillary bodies and anterior thalami. The symptoms include memory impairment, confabulation, and changes in affect.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options**:\n   - **A. Consumption of undercooked meat**: This is typically associated with infections like Toxoplasmosis, which does not match the clinical or imaging findings.\n   - **B. Chronic hypertension**: This is a risk factor for vascular dementia, which usually presents with more diffuse cognitive impairment and focal neurological deficits, not specifically the pattern seen here.\n   - **C. Alcohol use disorder**: This directly correlates with the findings of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, matching both the clinical presentation and imaging results.\n   - **D. Spirochete infection**: This could be indicative of neurosyphilis, which can cause cognitive deficits but typically involves more widespread brain atrophy and other neurological signs.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and the specific MRI findings, the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition is chronic alcohol use disorder.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
