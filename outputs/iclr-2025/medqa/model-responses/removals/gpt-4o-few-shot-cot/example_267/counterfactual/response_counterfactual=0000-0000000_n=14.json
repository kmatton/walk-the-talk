{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 60-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. He lives in a group home. During the appointment, he frequently repeats the same information and needs to be reminded why he is at the doctor's office. He says that he is a famous poet and recently had a poem published in a national magazine. His vital signs are within normal limits. He has a constricted affect. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, he has no long-term memory deficits and is able to count in serial sevens without error. An MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Consumption of undercooked meat\nB. Chronic hypertension\nC. Alcohol use disorder\nD. Spirochete infection\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To diagnose the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition, let's analyze the information given:\n\n1. **Patient's Behavior:** He frequently repeats information, needs reminders about his purpose at the doctor's office, and has delusions of grandeur (believing he is a famous poet). He also has a constricted affect, which suggests a possible mood disturbance.\n2. **Neurological and Mental Status Examination:**\n   - No focal neurological deficits, suggesting the issue might not be related to a focal brain lesion.\n   - No long-term memory deficits but has issues with short-term memory and executive function.\n3. **MRI Findings:**\n   - Atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies.\n\nThe constellation of symptoms (memory issues, confabulation, and delusions of grandeur) along with MRI findings (anterior thalamic and mammillary body atrophy) strongly suggests **Korsakoff syndrome**, which is a chronic memory disorder often associated with thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. This condition is typically seen in individuals with a history of chronic alcohol use disorder.\n\n- **Consumption of undercooked meat:** This is typically related to infections like toxoplasmosis, which would present differently.\n- **Chronic hypertension:** This can contribute to vascular dementia, but the specific MRI findings and the patient\u2019s symptoms are more characteristic of Korsakoff syndrome.\n- **Alcohol use disorder:** Chronic alcohol use leads to thiamine deficiency, which is the primary cause of Korsakoff syndrome. The MRI findings of mammillary body and thalamic atrophy are classic for this condition.\n- **Spirochete infection:** This refers to conditions like neurosyphilis, which can cause cognitive impairment but typically has other specific neurological signs and symptoms.\n\nThus, the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition is:\n\n**Answer: C**", "answer": "C"}
