{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 60-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. He lives in a group home and takes no medications. During the appointment, he frequently repeats the same information and needs to be reminded why he is at the doctor's office. He says that he is a famous poet and recently had a poem published in a national magazine. His vital signs are within normal limits. He has a constricted affect. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, he has no long-term memory deficits and is able to count in serial sevens without error. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Consumption of undercooked meat\nB. Chronic hypertension\nC. Alcohol use disorder\nD. Spirochete infection\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition, we need to consider the symptoms and their potential causes. The patient is showing signs of significant memory issues, repeating information, and confusion about the purpose of the visit, paired with a constricted affect. \n\n1. **Consumption of undercooked meat (A)**: This is primarily associated with infections like toxoplasmosis or certain parasitic infections, which do not typically present with the given neurological symptoms in an otherwise healthy adult.\n   \n2. **Chronic hypertension (B)**: Chronic hypertension can lead to vascular dementia, but the patient's specific presentation (repetitive speech and confabulation about being a famous poet) is not typical of this condition. Additionally, there are no signs of focal neurological deficits, which might be expected in cases of vascular dementia.\n\n3. **Alcohol use disorder (C)**: Alcohol use disorder can lead to Korsakoff syndrome, characterized by anterograde and retrograde amnesia, confabulation (making up stories), and cognitive impairment. This aligns well with the patient's presentation of repeating information and confabulating about being a famous poet. The constricted affect can also be consistent with alcohol-related brain damage.\n\n4. **Spirochete infection (D)**: This could refer to neurosyphilis, which can cause a range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms, including memory impairment. However, neurosyphilis typically presents with more diffuse neurological deficits and is less likely given the patient's specific pattern of memory issues and confabulation.\n\nConsidering these points, the presentation of repetitive speech, confabulation, and memory issues is most consistent with Korsakoff syndrome, which is associated with chronic alcohol use disorder.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
