{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 60-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. He lives in a group home and takes no medications. During the appointment, he frequently repeats the same information and needs to be reminded why he is at the doctor's office. He says that he is a famous poet and recently had a poem published in a national magazine. His vital signs are within normal limits. He has a constricted affect. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, he has no long-term memory deficits and is able to count in serial sevens without error. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Consumption of undercooked meat\nB. Chronic hypertension\nC. Alcohol use disorder\nD. Spirochete infection\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and determine the most likely underlying factor.\n\n1. **Frequent Repetition and Need for Reminders**: This suggests short-term memory impairment.\n2. **Delusions of Grandeur**: The patient believes he is a famous poet, which could indicate a cognitive disorder or psychosis.\n3. **Constricted Affect**: This might indicate a neurological or psychiatric condition.\n4. **No Long-term Memory Deficits and Ability to Perform Serial Sevens**: This suggests that some cognitive functions remain intact.\n5. **Living in a Group Home**: This might imply a history of mental health or cognitive issues requiring supervised living.\n6. **No Focal Neurological Deficits**: This suggests the absence of gross structural brain damage or acute neurological disease.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Consumption of undercooked meat**: This might suggest an infectious or parasitic cause such as toxoplasmosis, which typically presents differently and is less likely given the patient's cognitive profile.\n\nB. **Chronic hypertension**: While chronic hypertension can lead to vascular dementia, this patient does not present with the typical vascular cognitive impairment signs, such as focal neurological deficits.\n\nC. **Alcohol use disorder**: Alcohol use disorder can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, characterized by short-term memory impairment, confabulation (making up stories), and other cognitive difficulties. The patient's need for reminders and delusions could be consistent with this.\n\nD. **Spirochete infection**: This could refer to neurosyphilis, which can cause cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms. However, the patient's presentation is more suggestive of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome due to alcohol use.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of short-term memory impairment, delusions, and the absence of other focal neurological signs, the most likely predisposing factor is:\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
