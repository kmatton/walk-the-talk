He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx.

He lives in a group home and takes no medications. During the appointment, he frequently repeats the same information and needs to be reminded why he is at the doctor's office. He says that he is a famous poet and recently had a poem published in a national magazine. His vital signs are within normal limits. He has a constricted affect. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, he has no long-term memory deficits and is able to count in serial sevens without error. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Consumption of undercooked meat\nB. Chronic hypertension\nC. Alcohol use disorder\nD. Spirochete infection\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, let's consider the details provided step-by-step:\n\n1. **Frequent Repetition and Forgetfulness**: The patient needs constant reminders and frequently repeats information, indicating some form of short-term memory impairment.\n\n2. **Claim of Being a Famous Poet**: This might suggest delusions or false beliefs, which could be a symptom of a neuropsychiatric condition.\n\n3. **Constricted Affect**: This term indicates limited emotional expression, which can be seen in several psychiatric and neurological conditions.\n\n4. **No Long-term Memory Deficits and Normal Serial Sevens**: This suggests that the patient's cognitive function in certain areas remains intact, pointing towards a condition that selectively affects certain cognitive domains.\n\n5. **Living in a Group Home**: This might indicate he needs assistance with daily activities, possibly due to a chronic condition.\n\n6. **No Focal Neurological Deficits**: This rules out conditions that cause localized brain damage or dysfunction.\n\nGiven these symptoms, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Consumption of undercooked meat (A)**: This could lead to toxoplasmosis or other infections, but these typically cause more acute symptoms and not the chronic cognitive symptoms described here.\n  \n- **Chronic hypertension (B)**: While it can lead to vascular dementia, the patient\u2019s presentation of memory issues without focal neurological deficits makes this less likely.\n  \n- **Alcohol use disorder (C)**: Chronic alcohol use can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, characterized by memory problems and confabulation (making up stories), which fits well with the patient's symptoms.\n  \n- **Spirochete infection (D)**: This is associated with neurosyphilis, which can cause memory impairment and personality changes, but it's less common and the patient lacks other specific signs of neurosyphilis.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of memory impairment, confabulation, and a past that might suggest chronic alcohol use, the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition is:\n\n**Answer: C**", "answer": "C"}
