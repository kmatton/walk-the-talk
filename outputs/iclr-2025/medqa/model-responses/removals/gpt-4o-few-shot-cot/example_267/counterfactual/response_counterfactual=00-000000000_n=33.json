{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 60-year-old man comes to the physician. He lives in a group home and takes no medications. During the appointment, he frequently repeats the same information and needs to be reminded why he is at the doctor's office. He says that he is a famous poet and recently had a poem published in a national magazine. His vital signs are within normal limits. He has a constricted affect. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, he has no long-term memory deficits and is able to count in serial sevens without error. An MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Consumption of undercooked meat\nB. Chronic hypertension\nC. Alcohol use disorder\nD. Spirochete infection\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, we need to identify the clinical condition described and its etiology based on the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.\n\n1. **Symptoms and Findings**:\n   - The patient frequently repeats the same information and needs reminders, indicating short-term memory impairment.\n   - He believes he is a famous poet and recently had a poem published, which may suggest confabulation.\n   - His vital signs are normal, and he has a constricted affect.\n   - Neurological examination shows no focal deficits.\n   - MRI shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies.\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - These symptoms are characteristic of **Korsakoff syndrome**, which is often seen in the context of **Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome**. This condition typically occurs due to chronic thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency.\n   - The atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies on MRI is a hallmark of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\n   - The most common predisposing factor for this condition is chronic alcohol use, which leads to thiamine deficiency.\n\n3. **Options**:\n   - **A. Consumption of undercooked meat**: This option is more likely associated with infections such as toxoplasmosis and is not relevant to the described condition.\n   - **B. Chronic hypertension**: While hypertension can lead to vascular dementia, it does not typically present with the specific MRI findings described here.\n   - **C. Alcohol use disorder**: This is the most likely predisposing factor, as chronic alcohol use can lead to thiamine deficiency, causing Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\n   - **D. Spirochete infection**: This can cause neurosyphilis, but the symptoms and MRI findings are more consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome due to alcohol use.\n\nTherefore, the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition is:\n**Answer: C**", "answer": "C"}
