{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus.

He lives in a group home and takes no medications. During the appointment, he frequently repeats the same information and needs to be reminded why he is at the doctor's office. He says that he is a famous poet and recently had a poem published in a national magazine. He has a constricted affect. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, he has no long-term memory deficits and is able to count in serial sevens without error. An MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Consumption of undercooked meat\nB. Chronic hypertension\nC. Alcohol use disorder\nD. Spirochete infection\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "The patient's presentation, including memory issues, confabulation (the fabricated or distorted memories about oneself or the world), and MRI findings of atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mammillary bodies, is consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. This condition is typically associated with chronic alcohol use disorder, which leads to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency.\n\n- **Consumption of undercooked meat** is usually associated with toxoplasmosis or parasitic infections, which do not fit the clinical picture here.\n- **Chronic hypertension** can lead to vascular dementia, but it is associated with different MRI findings and symptomatology.\n- **Alcohol use disorder** is a known risk factor for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome due to poor nutritional intake leading to thiamine deficiency.\n- **Spirochete infection** refers to diseases like syphilis, which can affect the brain (neurosyphilis) but typically presents differently.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and MRI findings, the most likely predisposing factor is:\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
