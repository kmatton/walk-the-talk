{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 40-year-old obese man presents to his primary care provider with a history of excessive daytime somnolence and easy fatigability. Upon further questioning, it is found that although his sleeping hours are adequate, he does not feel refreshed in the morning. His wife complains that he snores loudly all night. After ruling out common medical disorders and possible drug abuse, he is advised an overnight polysomnogram that records episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep. Which of the following statements best describes this patient\u2019s condition?\nA. This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.\nB. Episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep.\nC. Mouth opening during sleep breaks the seal between the tongue and the teeth and relieves airway obstruction.\nD. Gynoid obesity is associated with apnea and hypopnea more frequently as compared to android obesity.\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the question and each answer option step by step. \n\nThis patient has symptoms indicative of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), such as excessive daytime somnolence, non-refreshing sleep, and loud snoring. The overnight polysomnogram shows episodes of apnea and hypopnea.\n\n**Option A: \"This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.\"**\n- The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is calculated as the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. In this case, the patient has 30 episodes of hypopnea over 7 hours of sleep, resulting in an AHI of 30/7 \u2248 4.29. This is actually less than 5, so this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option B: \"Episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep.\"**\n- Episodes of apnea and hypopnea actually occur more frequently during the lighter stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and even more during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep when muscle tone is reduced. Thus, this option is also incorrect.\n\n**Option C: \"Mouth opening during sleep breaks the seal between the tongue and the teeth and relieves airway obstruction.\"**\n- In OSA, mouth opening often worsens airway obstruction rather than relieving it. This is because mouth breathing can cause the tongue to fall back and obstruct the airway. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: \"Gynoid obesity is associated with apnea and hypopnea more frequently as compared to android obesity.\"**\n- Android obesity (central obesity) is actually more commonly associated with obstructive sleep apnea than gynoid obesity (peripheral or lower body obesity). Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the options seem correct based on the information provided. However, considering the context provided regarding the AHI calculation, there might be a misunderstanding in the provided scenario. If the \"episodes\" mentioned include both apneas and hypopneas, the total number would be higher. Let's revisit the calculations:\n\nIf the total number of episodes (apnea + hypopnea) is 30, then:\n- AHI = 30 episodes / 7 hours = approximately 4.29, still less than 5.\n\nGiven this, based on standard medical knowledge and the provided details, the most accurate option based on the typical prevalence and definitions is:\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
