{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 40-year-old obese man presents to his primary care provider with a history of excessive daytime somnolence and easy fatigability. Upon further questioning, it is found that although his sleeping hours are adequate, he does not feel refreshed in the morning. His wife complains that he snores loudly all night. After ruling out common medical disorders and possible drug abuse, he is advised an overnight polysomnogram that records 12 episodes of apnea during a 7-hour sleep. Which of the following statements best describes this patient\u2019s condition?\nA. This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.\nB. Episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep.\nC. Mouth opening during sleep breaks the seal between the tongue and the teeth and relieves airway obstruction.\nD. Gynoid obesity is associated with apnea and hypopnea more frequently as compared to android obesity.\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve the question step-by-step, we need to analyze the given information and understand the context of the patient's condition.\n\n1. **Patient Profile**: A 40-year-old obese man with excessive daytime somnolence and easy fatigability. Despite adequate sleeping hours, he does not feel refreshed in the morning. He snores loudly, as reported by his wife.\n\n2. **Diagnostic Test**: The patient underwent an overnight polysomnogram, which recorded 12 episodes of apnea during a 7-hour sleep.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - **Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)**: AHI is calculated as the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. Here, the patient had 12 episodes over 7 hours.\n     - AHI = 12 episodes / 7 hours = 1.71 episodes per hour.\n     - AHI > 5 would indicate a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Since 1.71 < 5, this does not meet the criteria for OSA.\n   \n   - **Apnea and Hypopnea Occurrence**: These events are more likely to occur during REM sleep when the airway muscles are more relaxed, rather than deeper stages of non-REM sleep.\n\n   - **Mouth Opening and Airway Obstruction**: Mouth opening can potentially worsen airway obstruction in some cases because it might lead to the collapse of the tongue against the back of the throat.\n\n   - **Obesity Distribution**: Android obesity (central obesity) is more strongly associated with sleep apnea compared to gynoid obesity (fat distribution around hips and thighs).\n\nNow, let's match these insights with the given options:\n\nA. This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.\n   - This is incorrect because AHI = 1.71, which is less than 5.\n\nB. Episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep.\n   - This is incorrect because apnea and hypopnea are more likely during REM sleep.\n\nC. Mouth opening during sleep breaks the seal between the tongue and the teeth and relieves airway obstruction.\n   - This is incorrect because mouth opening can worsen airway obstruction.\n\nD. Gynoid obesity is associated with apnea and hypopnea more frequently as compared to android obesity.\n   - This is incorrect because android obesity is more strongly associated with sleep apnea.\n\nGiven these analyses, none of the provided statements seem to be entirely accurate based on the patient's condition. However, if we must choose the least incorrect statement:\n- Option A overstates the severity of the condition based on AHI criteria.\n- Option B misstates the sleep stage during which apneas are more common.\n- Option C incorrectly describes the effect of mouth opening.\n- Option D incorrectly attributes the association of obesity types.\n\nGiven the constraints, the closest but still incorrect statement would be:\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
