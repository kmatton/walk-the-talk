{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 40-year-old obese man presents to his primary care provider with a history of excessive daytime somnolence and easy fatigability. Upon further questioning, it is found that although his sleeping hours are adequate, he does not feel refreshed in the morning. After ruling out common medical disorders and possible drug abuse, he is advised an overnight polysomnogram that records 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep. Which of the following statements best describes this patient\u2019s condition?\nA. This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.\nB. Episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep.\nC. Mouth opening during sleep breaks the seal between the tongue and the teeth and relieves airway obstruction.\nD. Gynoid obesity is associated with apnea and hypopnea more frequently as compared to android obesity.\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve the question, let's analyze the provided information and each of the answer choices systematically.\n\nThe patient has excessive daytime somnolence and easy fatigability despite adequate sleeping hours, indicating a potential sleep disorder. The overnight polysomnogram recorded 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea in a 7-hour sleep period.\n\n1. **Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)**:\n   - AHI is calculated as the total number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep.\n   - In this case: \\( AHI = \\frac{12 \\, (apneas) + 30 \\, (hypopneas)}{7 \\, (hours)} = \\frac{42}{7} = 6 \\)\n   - This index of 6 is indeed more than 5.\n   - Therefore, Answer A is correct.\n\n2. **Episodes of Apnea and Hypopnea**:\n   - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) episodes are generally more common during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep when muscle tone decreases, not deeper stages of non-REM sleep.\n   - Therefore, Answer B is incorrect.\n\n3. **Mouth Opening During Sleep**:\n   - Mouth opening during sleep can actually exacerbate airway obstruction as it can allow the tongue to fall back and obstruct the airway.\n   - Therefore, Answer C is incorrect.\n\n4. **Gynoid vs. Android Obesity**:\n   - Android obesity (central obesity) is more closely associated with OSA due to fat deposition around the neck and upper airway.\n   - Gynoid obesity (fat deposition in the hips and thighs) is less likely to contribute to airway obstruction.\n   - Therefore, Answer D is incorrect.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
