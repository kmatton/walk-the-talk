This is evidenced by her refusal to accept her underweight status, self-perception as overweight, and refusal to eat.\n\n3. **Treatment Options**:\n   - **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: This is a well-established treatment for eating disorders, particularly effective in modifying distorted body image and unhealthy eating behaviors.\n   - **In-patient psychiatric therapy**: This is necessary for acute stabilization but may not be the primary long-term management strategy unless severe and life-threatening symptoms persist.\n   - **Antidepressants**: These can be adjunctive treatments but are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n   - **Appetite stimulants**: These are not typically used in the management of eating disorders due to their limited efficacy in addressing the underlying psychological issues.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the chronic nature of the condition and the need for long-term management strategies that address both psychological and behavioral components, **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** is the most appropriate long-term treatment.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
