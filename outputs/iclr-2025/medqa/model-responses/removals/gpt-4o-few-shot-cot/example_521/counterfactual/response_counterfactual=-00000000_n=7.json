Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "The patient presents with symptoms and behaviors indicative of an eating disorder, likely anorexia nervosa, given her refusal to eat and her distorted body image. Long-term management of anorexia nervosa primarily involves psychological therapy to address the underlying issues related to body image and eating behaviors.\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: This is a well-established treatment for eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa. It focuses on changing the patient's unhealthy thought patterns and behaviors related to food and body image.\n- **In-patient psychiatric therapy**: While this might be necessary for acute management if the patient's condition is life-threatening, it is not typically the long-term solution. It may be part of the initial treatment but not the primary long-term management strategy.\n- **Antidepressants**: These are not the first line of treatment for anorexia nervosa, though they may be used adjunctively if there is coexisting depression or anxiety.\n- **Appetite stimulants**: These are not typically used in the treatment of anorexia nervosa, as the issue is more psychological than physiological regarding appetite.\n\nGiven the above considerations, the best option for long-term management is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
