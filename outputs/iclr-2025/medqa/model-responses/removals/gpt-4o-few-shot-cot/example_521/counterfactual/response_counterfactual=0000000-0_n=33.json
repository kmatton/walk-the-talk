The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the best option for long-term management of this patient\u2019s condition, let's carefully analyze the clinical scenario and consider the appropriate treatment strategies.\n\n1. The patient is a 19-year-old woman who collapsed during a cheerleading practice, showing signs of hypotension (88/55 mm Hg) and bradycardia (pulse 55/min).\n2. She was given isotonic fluids but continues to refuse further treatment, including intravenous fluids and hospital meals.\n3. She is noted to be anorexic and fervently denies being underweight despite evident physical signs.\n4. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by a refusal to maintain a minimally normal body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted body image.\n\nGiven these details, the best long-term management strategy for anorexia nervosa typically involves a multidisciplinary approach. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in treating anorexia nervosa by addressing the cognitive distortions and behaviors related to the eating disorder.\n\nOther options such as in-patient psychiatric therapy, antidepressants, and appetite stimulants can be part of the treatment plan, but they are not considered the primary long-term management strategy.\n\nLet's review each option:\n- A. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line treatment for many eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa. It targets the cognitive distortions and unhealthy behaviors associated with the disorder.\n- B. In-patient psychiatric therapy may be necessary for acute stabilization but is not a long-term solution.\n- C. Antidepressants may be used to address comorbid conditions like depression but are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n- D. Appetite stimulants are generally not used as the main treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
