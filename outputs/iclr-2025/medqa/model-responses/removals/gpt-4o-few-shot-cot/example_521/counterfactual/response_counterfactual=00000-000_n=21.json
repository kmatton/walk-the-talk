Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion.

At the emergency department, she is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is \u2018a fatty\u2019 and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals.

Appetite stimulants\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, we need to identify the most appropriate long-term management for a patient exhibiting signs of an eating disorder, specifically anorexia nervosa. The key elements in the case are:\n\n1. The patient has collapsed, indicating a severe physical manifestation of her condition.\n2. She has a low blood pressure (88/55 mm Hg) and a low pulse (55/min).\n3. She denies being underweight and refers to herself as \"a fatty,\" indicating a distorted body image and denial of her condition.\n4. She refuses intravenous fluids and hospital meals.\n\nGiven these factors, we need to consider the most effective long-term management approach:\n\n- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** is a well-established treatment for anorexia nervosa that addresses distorted thoughts and behaviors related to body image and eating.\n\n- **In-patient psychiatric therapy** may be necessary for immediate stabilization and intensive treatment, especially if the patient is medically unstable, but this is more of an acute intervention rather than a long-term management strategy.\n\n- **Antidepressants** can be used as an adjunct in some cases of eating disorders, particularly if there is comorbid depression or anxiety, but they are not the primary long-term treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n\n- **Appetite stimulants** are not typically used as a primary treatment for anorexia nervosa due to the complex psychopathology involved.\n\nConsidering the severity of the patient\u2019s condition and the need for a structured and long-term approach to address her distorted body image and eating behaviors, **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** is the best option for long-term management.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
