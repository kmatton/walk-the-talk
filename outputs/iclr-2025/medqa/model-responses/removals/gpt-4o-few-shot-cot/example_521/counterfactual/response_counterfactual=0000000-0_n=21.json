Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the best option for long-term management of this patient\u2019s condition, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Patient Profile:**\n   - 19-year-old woman\n   - Collapsed during cheerleading practice\n   - Vitals: Blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min\n   - Received isotonic fluid en route to the hospital\n   - Alert and oriented in the emergency department\n   - Noted to be anorexic\n   - Denies being underweight\n   - Refuses further intravenous fluid and hospital meals\n\n2. **Symptoms and Behavioral Cues:**\n   - The patient has a low blood pressure and pulse, which can be indicative of malnutrition or dehydration.\n   - Anorexic condition and refusal to acknowledge being underweight suggest a possible eating disorder, likely anorexia nervosa.\n   - Refusal of treatment and hospital meals further support this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Long-term Management:**\n   - **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Effective for treating eating disorders by addressing distorted thoughts and behaviors.\n   - **In-patient psychiatric therapy**: Necessary for severe cases where medical stabilization and intensive monitoring are required.\n   - **Antidepressants**: Can be helpful as an adjunct treatment but not the primary approach for anorexia.\n   - **Appetite stimulants**: Not typically used as a primary treatment for anorexia, as the issue is more psychological than physiological.\n\nGiven the patient's refusal of meals and intravenous fluids, she may require initial stabilization and intensive treatment. However, for long-term management, **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** is recognized as the most effective treatment for anorexia nervosa. It helps in changing the patient's thought patterns and behaviors related to food and body image.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
