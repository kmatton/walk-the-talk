She is alert and oriented upon arrival at the emergency department but is noted to be anorexic.\n   \n2. **Psychological Symptoms**: The patient denies being underweight and has a distorted body image, claiming she is \"a fatty\" despite being anorexic. This suggests a potential eating disorder, specifically anorexia nervosa.\n\n3. **Long-term Management**:\n   - **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: \n     - CBT is commonly used for treating eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa. It helps patients address and change the distorted thought patterns and behaviors related to their body image and eating habits.\n   - **In-patient Psychiatric Therapy**:\n     - This could be necessary for severe cases where there are significant medical complications or risk to the patient\u2019s life. However, the long-term goal is often to transition to outpatient care to continue therapy.\n   - **Antidepressants**:\n     - While these can be helpful in managing coexisting conditions such as depression or anxiety, they are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n   - **Appetite Stimulants**:\n     - These might address the symptom of low appetite but do not address the underlying psychological issues of the eating disorder.\n\nGiven the information, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the most appropriate long-term management option for anorexia nervosa, as it addresses the root psychological issues and helps modify the distorted thoughts and behaviors associated with the disorder.\n\n**Answer**: A", "answer": "A"}
