Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

Her vitals taken by the emergency medical services (EMS) include blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min. She was given a liter of isotonic fluid while en route to the hospital. At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is \u2018a fatty\u2019 and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient\u2019s condition?\nA. Cognitive-behavioral therapy\nB. In-patient psychiatric therapy\nC. Antidepressants\nD. Appetite stimulants\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the information provided and determine the best option for long-term management of the patient's condition.\n\n1. **Symptoms and Presentation**: The patient is a 19-year-old female who collapsed during cheerleading practice. Her vitals indicate hypotension (88/55 mm Hg) and bradycardia (pulse 55/min). She received isotonic fluid en route to the hospital but refused further treatment and meals, indicating a significant disturbance in her eating behavior and perception of body image.\n\n2. **Diagnosis**: The given symptoms and behavior strongly suggest an eating disorder, specifically anorexia nervosa. This is supported by her refusal to accept that she is underweight, her denial of needing treatment, and her distorted body image (\"a fatty\").\n\n3. **Treatment Options**:\n   - **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: This is a well-established, evidence-based treatment for eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa. CBT focuses on changing maladaptive thoughts and behaviors associated with eating and body image.\n   - **In-patient psychiatric therapy**: This may be necessary for severe cases where the patient is at immediate risk or unable to manage their condition in an outpatient setting. However, the question asks for long-term management, and in-patient therapy is typically more of an acute intervention.\n   - **Antidepressants**: These can be helpful in managing comorbid depression or anxiety but are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n   - **Appetite stimulants**: These are not typically used in the management of anorexia nervosa as the issue is more about the psychological aspect of eating rather than a lack of appetite.\n\n4. **Best Option**: Given the chronic nature of the condition and the need for long-term management that addresses the underlying psychological factors, Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
