These are characteristic signs of anorexia nervosa.\n\n2. **Understanding Anorexia Nervosa**: Anorexia nervosa is a serious psychiatric disorder that requires comprehensive treatment. It typically includes both medical and psychological components.\n\n3. **Treatment Options**:\n    - **A. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: CBT is the most evidence-based psychological treatment for anorexia nervosa. It focuses on changing maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors related to body image and food intake.\n    - **B. In-patient psychiatric therapy**: This may be necessary for acute stabilization, especially if the patient is at risk of severe malnutrition or medical complications. However, it is more of an acute intervention than a long-term management strategy.\n    - **C. Antidepressants**: While these can be useful adjuncts in treating comorbid conditions like depression and anxiety, they are not first-line treatments for anorexia nervosa itself.\n    - **D. Appetite stimulants**: These are generally not effective for treating anorexia nervosa, as the condition is not primarily due to a lack of appetite but rather a psychological issue.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best long-term management for anorexia nervosa involves addressing the psychological aspects of the disorder through evidence-based therapies. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is recommended as the primary treatment due to its effectiveness in treating the underlying psychological issues associated with anorexia nervosa.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
