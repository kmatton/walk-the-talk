{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx.

She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions.

Her vitals taken by the emergency medical services (EMS) include blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min. She was given a liter of isotonic fluid while en route to the hospital. At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient\u2019s condition?\nA. Cognitive-behavioral therapy\nB. In-patient psychiatric therapy\nC. Antidepressants\nD. Appetite stimulants\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "The patient's presentation, including low blood pressure, bradycardia, and anorexia, along with her denial of being underweight and refusal of treatment, strongly suggests an eating disorder, likely anorexia nervosa. Managing anorexia nervosa often requires a comprehensive approach, including psychological interventions and medical monitoring.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: This is a primary treatment for eating disorders and focuses on changing the patient's thoughts and behaviors related to food and body image. It has been shown to be effective in the long-term management of anorexia nervosa.\n\n2. **In-patient psychiatric therapy**: This may be necessary for severe cases, especially if there are medical complications or the patient is at immediate risk. However, the question asks for long-term management, and in-patient therapy is often short-term and intensive, aimed at stabilizing the patient.\n\n3. **Antidepressants**: While medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be helpful, particularly if there is comorbid depression or anxiety, they are not the primary long-term treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n\n4. **Appetite stimulants**: These are generally not effective for treating anorexia nervosa because the issue is more psychological than physiological.\n\nGiven the information and focusing on long-term management, the best option is likely to be an evidence-based psychological intervention, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\n### Answer: A", "answer": "A"}
