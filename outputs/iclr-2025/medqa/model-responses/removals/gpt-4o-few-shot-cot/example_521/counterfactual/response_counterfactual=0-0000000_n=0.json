He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

Her vitals taken by the emergency medical services (EMS) include blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min. She was given a liter of isotonic fluid while en route to the hospital. At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is \u2018a fatty\u2019 and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient\u2019s condition?\nA. Cognitive-behavioral therapy\nB. In-patient psychiatric therapy\nC. Antidepressants\nD. Appetite stimulants\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this step-by-step, we need to consider the patient's presentation and the long-term management of her condition.\n\n1. **Patient Presentation:**\n   - The patient is a 19-year-old female who collapsed, indicating a potential acute issue.\n   - She has hypotension (88/55 mm Hg) and bradycardia (pulse 55/min).\n   - She was given isotonic fluids, suggesting potential dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.\n   - She is alert and oriented but has an anorexic presentation.\n   - She denies being underweight and refers to herself as \u2018a fatty,\u2019 indicating a distorted body image.\n   - She refuses further intravenous fluids and hospital meals, which is consistent with anorexia nervosa.\n\n2. **Diagnosis:**\n   - The clinical features (hypotension, bradycardia, distorted body image, refusal to eat, and anorexic presentation) strongly suggest anorexia nervosa.\n\n3. **Long-term Management Options:**\n   - **A. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT):** CBT is often the first-line treatment for anorexia nervosa. It addresses the distorted body image and unhealthy behaviors related to eating.\n   - **B. In-patient psychiatric therapy:** This is considered if the patient is at significant medical risk or if outpatient treatment fails. Given that she is refusing treatment, this could be necessary.\n   - **C. Antidepressants:** These are not typically the first-line treatment for anorexia nervosa unless there is a co-morbid condition such as depression.\n   - **D. Appetite stimulants:** These are generally not effective as primary treatment for anorexia nervosa, as they do not address the underlying psychological issues.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation and the need for long-term management to address the psychological aspects of anorexia nervosa, **cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** is typically the most appropriate first-line treatment. However, the severity of her condition might necessitate more intensive treatment initially.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
