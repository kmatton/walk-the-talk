The key features include:\n\n- Low blood pressure (88/55 mm Hg)\n- Bradycardia (pulse 55/min)\n- Anorexia and denial of being underweight despite likely being underweight\n- Refusal of intravenous fluids and meals, reflecting a distorted body image and fear of weight gain\n\n### Treatment Options Analysis:\n\nA. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**\n   - CBT is the first-line treatment for many psychiatric conditions, including eating disorders. It focuses on changing distorted thinking patterns and behaviors. For anorexia nervosa, CBT can be particularly effective in addressing the irrational fears related to weight and body image.\n\nB. **In-patient Psychiatric Therapy**\n   - This option is generally reserved for severe cases where there are immediate life-threatening concerns, such as severe malnutrition or medical instability. It provides a controlled environment where intensive monitoring and refeeding can occur.\n\nC. **Antidepressants**\n   - While antidepressants can be helpful for associated mood disorders, they are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa. Their efficacy is more limited in treating the core symptoms of the eating disorder itself.\n\nD. **Appetite Stimulants**\n   - These are not typically used as a primary treatment for eating disorders like anorexia nervosa. The issue in anorexia nervosa is more related to psychological factors than a lack of appetite.\n\nGiven that the patient is alert, oriented, and refusing food and fluids due to her distorted body image, the best long-term management would focus on addressing these cognitive distortions and behaviors.\n\n### Conclusion:\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targets the psychological aspects of anorexia nervosa and is considered the best option for long-term management.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
