Anorexia nervosa is characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight, a distorted body image, and significant weight loss. The long-term management of anorexia nervosa usually involves a multidisciplinary approach, including medical, psychological, and nutritional support.\n\nLet's evaluate the provided options for long-term management:\n\nA. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) - CBT is a well-established psychological treatment for various mental health conditions, including eating disorders. It focuses on changing the distorted thoughts and behaviors related to food, eating, and body image.\n\nB. In-patient psychiatric therapy - This may be necessary for severe cases of anorexia nervosa where there are serious medical complications or where the patient is at risk of harming themselves. However, it is not always necessary for every case and may not be a long-term solution.\n\nC. Antidepressants - These may be useful in treating co-morbid conditions like depression and anxiety, which often accompany eating disorders. However, they are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n\nD. Appetite stimulants - These are not typically used in the management of anorexia nervosa, as the primary issue is psychological rather than a lack of appetite.\n\nConsidering the options, the best long-term management for this patient would involve addressing the psychological aspects of her condition, which can be effectively targeted through Cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
