Anorexia nervosa is typically managed with a multidisciplinary approach, and long-term management focuses on addressing the underlying psychological issues and behaviors associated with the disorder. Let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) - CBT is a well-established treatment for eating disorders. It helps patients change their distorted thoughts and behaviors related to food, body image, and self-esteem. CBT is effective for long-term management.\n\nB. In-patient psychiatric therapy - This is usually reserved for severe cases, especially when there is a risk of medical complications or significant psychiatric comorbidity that cannot be managed on an outpatient basis. However, this is not typically the first-line long-term management approach unless the case is severe.\n\nC. Antidepressants - While these can be helpful in managing comorbid depression or anxiety, they are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa. They can be used as an adjunct to psychotherapy but not as the sole long-term management strategy.\n\nD. Appetite stimulants - These are not typically used in the management of anorexia nervosa. The issue in anorexia nervosa is not just a lack of appetite, but a complex psychological disorder involving body image and fear of gaining weight.\n\nGiven the options, the most appropriate and effective long-term management for this patient is:\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
