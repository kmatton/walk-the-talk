Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: This is a well-established treatment for anorexia nervosa, focusing on changing distorted thoughts and behaviors related to food and body image.\n   - **B. In-patient psychiatric therapy**: This is often necessary when a patient is severely malnourished or at immediate risk, but it is typically used for acute stabilization rather than long-term management.\n   - **C. Antidepressants**: These may be helpful if there is a coexisting mood disorder, but they are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n   - **D. Appetite stimulants**: These are not typically used in the treatment of anorexia nervosa because the issue is primarily psychological rather than physiological.\n\n5. **Long-term Management**:\n   - The best long-term management strategy for anorexia nervosa involves addressing the underlying psychological issues and developing healthier eating behaviors and attitudes towards body image. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most evidence-based long-term treatment approach for this condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the patient's condition and the options provided, the most appropriate long-term management strategy is Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
