Given her physical state (low blood pressure and low pulse rate) and her refusal to eat or accept fluids, this indicates a severe condition that requires immediate and long-term intervention.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n\nA. **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: This is a common and effective treatment for eating disorders, especially for addressing the underlying cognitive distortions and behaviors associated with the disorder. However, it is primarily an outpatient treatment and not typically the first step in severe cases requiring immediate medical stabilization.\n\nB. **In-patient psychiatric therapy**: Given the severity of her condition and her refusal to accept necessary medical interventions, in-patient treatment is necessary for medical stabilization and close monitoring. This allows for comprehensive care, including nutritional rehabilitation and psychiatric support, which is crucial in severe cases of anorexia nervosa.\n\nC. **Antidepressants**: While antidepressants can be helpful in treating coexisting mood disorders, they are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa and are not effective for the core symptoms of the eating disorder itself.\n\nD. **Appetite stimulants**: These are generally not effective or appropriate as a first-line treatment for anorexia nervosa. The issue is not just a lack of appetite but a complex interplay of psychological, emotional, and behavioral factors.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the patient's severe symptoms and immediate medical needs, the best option for her long-term management is in-patient psychiatric therapy, where she can receive the comprehensive care required for her condition.\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
