It helps patients address and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n\n2. **In-patient psychiatric therapy**:\n   - This is typically reserved for severe cases where there is a risk of harm to the patient, such as extreme malnutrition or severe psychiatric symptoms that cannot be managed on an outpatient basis.\n\n3. **Antidepressants**:\n   - These can be used as adjunct therapy in eating disorders, especially if there is concurrent depression or anxiety. However, they are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa.\n\n4. **Appetite stimulants**:\n   - These are not typically used in the management of anorexia nervosa, as the issue is more psychological rather than a lack of physical appetite.\n\nGiven her symptoms and behaviors, such as denying being underweight and refusing treatment, she may have anorexia nervosa.
