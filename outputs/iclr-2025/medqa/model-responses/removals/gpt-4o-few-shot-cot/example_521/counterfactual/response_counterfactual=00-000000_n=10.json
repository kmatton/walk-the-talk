Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

Her vitals taken by the emergency medical services (EMS) include blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min. She was given a liter of isotonic fluid while en route to the hospital. At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is \u2018a fatty\u2019 and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals.

Appetite stimulants\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the best option for long-term management of this patient\u2019s condition, let's first identify the most likely diagnosis. The patient presents with hypotension (low blood pressure), bradycardia (slow heart rate), and signs of anorexia nervosa, such as a distorted body image and refusal to maintain a healthy body weight. Anorexia nervosa is a serious psychiatric disorder that requires comprehensive treatment.\n\nGiven the severity of the patient's condition and her refusal of necessary medical treatment, intensive and structured treatment is needed. Let's consider each option:\n\nA. **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: While CBT is an effective treatment for anorexia nervosa, it is typically used as an outpatient therapy for patients who are medically stable. This patient's vital signs and refusal of treatment suggest she is not stable enough for outpatient therapy alone.\n\nB. **In-patient psychiatric therapy**: This option provides a structured environment with medical and psychiatric supervision, which is crucial given the patient's current physical and psychological state. It allows for medical stabilization, nutritional rehabilitation, and intensive psychotherapy.\n\nC. **Antidepressants**: These medications can be beneficial for treating co-occurring conditions like depression and anxiety, but they are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa. They would not address the immediate medical needs or distorted eating behaviors.\n\nD. **Appetite stimulants**: These are not appropriate as the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa. The issue is not a lack of appetite but a severe psychiatric disorder requiring comprehensive treatment.\n\nGiven the patient's current condition, the best option for long-term management is:\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
