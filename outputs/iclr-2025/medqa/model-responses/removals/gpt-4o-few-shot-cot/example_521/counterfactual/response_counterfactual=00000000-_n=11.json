Long-term management of anorexia nervosa focuses on both psychological and nutritional rehabilitation.\n\n- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** is the first-line treatment for anorexia nervosa. It helps patients understand and change their distorted thinking and behaviors related to food and body image.\n\n- **In-patient psychiatric therapy** may be necessary for severe cases, particularly if there are medical complications or a high risk of self-harm, but the long-term goal is often outpatient management once the patient is medically stable.\n\n- **Antidepressants** are generally not first-line treatments for anorexia nervosa unless there is a comorbid condition such as major depressive disorder or anxiety.\n\n- **Appetite stimulants** are not typically used in the treatment of anorexia nervosa as the issue is more about psychological barriers to eating rather than a lack of appetite.\n\nGiven the information provided and focusing on long-term management:\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
