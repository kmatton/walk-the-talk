{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with altered mental status. The patient is in acute distress and cannot provide history due to disorientation. Temperature is 38.7\u00b0C (101.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, pulse is 103/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and BMI is 20 kg/m2. On examination, his sclera and skin are icteric. On abdominal examination, the patient moans with deep palpation to his right upper quadrant. Laboratory test Complete blood count Hemoglobin 14.5 g/dL MCV 88 fl Leukocytes 16,500/mm3 Platelets 170,000/mm3 Basic metabolic panel Serum Na+ 147 mEq/L Serum K+ 3.8 mEq/L Serum Cl- 106 mEq/L Serum HCO3- 25 mEq/L BUN 30 mg/dL Serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL Liver function test Total bilirubin 2.8 mg/dL AST 50 U/L ALT 65 U/L ALP 180 U/L The patient is treated urgently with intravenous fluid, dopamine, and broad spectrum antibiotics. On ultrasound of the abdomen, the common bile duct is dilated. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?\nA. ERCP\nB. MRCP\nC. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram\nD. CT abdomen\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the best course of action for this patient, let's analyze the clinical presentation and the information provided:\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: \n   - **Altered mental status**: Indicates a serious systemic condition.\n   - **Vital signs**: Fever (38.7\u00b0C), hypotension (80/50 mm Hg), tachycardia (103/min), and respiratory rate (22/min) suggest sepsis or a severe infection.\n   - **Physical examination**: Icterus (jaundice) and right upper quadrant tenderness point towards a hepatobiliary issue, likely obstructive.\n   \n2. **Laboratory Findings**:\n   - **Elevated bilirubin (2.8 mg/dL)**: Suggests cholestasis or bile duct obstruction.\n   - **Elevated liver enzymes (AST 50 U/L, ALT 65 U/L, ALP 180 U/L)**: Further suggests hepatobiliary involvement.\n   - **Leukocytosis (16,500/mm3)**: Indicates infection or inflammation.\n   \n3. **Imaging**:\n   - **Ultrasound**: Shows a dilated common bile duct, which strongly indicates a biliary obstruction.\n\nGiven this context, the most likely diagnosis is acute cholangitis, a severe infection of the biliary system often due to bile duct obstruction (e.g., gallstones, strictures).\n\n**Management**:\n- **ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography)**: This is both diagnostic and therapeutic. It allows for visualization of the bile ducts and can be used to relieve the obstruction, extract stones, and place stents if necessary. Given the acute presentation and the need for prompt management, ERCP is the most appropriate next step.\n\n**Other options**:\n- **MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography)**: This is a non-invasive imaging test to visualize the biliary and pancreatic ducts but does not provide therapeutic intervention.\n- **Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram**: This is another diagnostic imaging technique used to visualize the biliary tree but is more invasive and not the first line in acute settings.\n- **CT abdomen**: While useful for detailed imaging of abdominal structures, it is not the best choice for immediate therapeutic intervention of bile duct obstruction.\n\nThus, the best next step in management is:\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
