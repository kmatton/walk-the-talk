{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with altered mental status. The patient is in acute distress and cannot provide history due to disorientation. On examination, his sclera and skin are icteric. On abdominal examination, the patient moans with deep palpation to his right upper quadrant. Laboratory test Complete blood count Hemoglobin 14.5 g/dL MCV 88 fl Leukocytes 16,500/mm3 Platelets 170,000/mm3 Basic metabolic panel Serum Na+ 147 mEq/L Serum K+ 3.8 mEq/L Serum Cl- 106 mEq/L Serum HCO3- 25 mEq/L BUN 30 mg/dL Serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL Liver function test Total bilirubin 2.8 mg/dL AST 50 U/L ALT 65 U/L ALP 180 U/L The patient is treated urgently with intravenous fluid, dopamine, and broad spectrum antibiotics. The patient\u2019s blood pressure improves to 101/70 mm Hg. On ultrasound of the abdomen, the common bile duct is dilated. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?\nA. ERCP\nB. MRCP\nC. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram\nD. CT abdomen\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the best next step in the management of the patient, let's analyze the clinical scenario and laboratory findings step-by-step:\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient, a 55-year-old man, presents with altered mental status and is in acute distress. He is disoriented and has icteric sclera and skin. There is tenderness in the right upper quadrant on abdominal examination.\n\n2. **Laboratory Findings**:\n   - **Complete Blood Count**: Elevated leukocytes (16,500/mm\u00b3) suggest an infection or inflammation.\n   - **Basic Metabolic Panel**: Mostly within normal range, except for slightly elevated BUN (30 mg/dL), which could indicate dehydration or renal perfusion issues.\n   - **Liver Function Tests**: Elevated total bilirubin (2.8 mg/dL), AST (50 U/L), ALT (65 U/L), and ALP (180 U/L) indicate liver dysfunction or biliary obstruction.\n\n3. **Abdominal Ultrasound**: Shows a dilated common bile duct, which is highly suggestive of biliary obstruction, commonly due to choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stones) or other obstructive pathology.\n\nGiven the clinical context of jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, and dilated common bile duct on ultrasound, the most likely diagnosis is acute cholangitis. This is a medical emergency and requires both urgent antibiotic therapy and biliary drainage.\n\n**Next Steps in Management**:\n- **ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography)** is the preferred next step for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. It can confirm the diagnosis of biliary obstruction and allow for interventions such as stone removal or stent placement to relieve the obstruction.\n- **MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography)** is a non-invasive imaging modality that can visualize the biliary tree, but it is not therapeutic. It is more appropriate for diagnostic purposes when there is no immediate need for intervention.\n- **Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiogram** is another option for biliary imaging and drainage, typically considered when ERCP is not feasible.\n- **CT Abdomen** can provide additional anatomical detail and may help identify other causes of abdominal pain, but it is not the first choice for direct biliary intervention in this acute setting.\n\nGiven the urgent need for both diagnosis and potential intervention, **ERCP** is the best next step.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
