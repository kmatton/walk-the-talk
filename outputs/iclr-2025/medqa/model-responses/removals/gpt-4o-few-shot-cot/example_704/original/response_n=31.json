{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with altered mental status. The patient is in acute distress and cannot provide history due to disorientation. Temperature is 38.7\u00b0C (101.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, pulse is 103/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and BMI is 20 kg/m2. On examination, his sclera and skin are icteric. On abdominal examination, the patient moans with deep palpation to his right upper quadrant.\nLaboratory test\nComplete blood count\nHemoglobin 14.5 g/dL\nMCV 88 fl\nLeukocytes 16,500/mm3\nPlatelets 170,000/mm3\nBasic metabolic panel\nSerum Na+ 147 mEq/L\nSerum K+ 3.8 mEq/L\nSerum Cl- 106 mEq/L\nSerum HCO3- 25 mEq/L\nBUN 30 mg/dL\nSerum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL\nLiver function test\nTotal bilirubin 2.8 mg/dL\nAST 50 U/L\nALT 65 U/L\nALP 180 U/L\nThe patient is treated urgently with intravenous fluid, dopamine, and broad spectrum antibiotics. The patient\u2019s blood pressure improves to 101/70 mm Hg. On ultrasound of the abdomen, the common bile duct is dilated. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?\nA. ERCP\nB. MRCP\nC. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram\nD. CT abdomen\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this case, let's analyze the patient's symptoms, clinical findings, and laboratory results step-by-step.\n\n1. **Symptoms and Examination**:\n   - Altered mental status\n   - Acute distress and disorientation\n   - Fever (38.7\u00b0C)\n   - Hypotension (80/50 mm Hg)\n   - Tachycardia (103/min)\n   - Respiratory rate (22/min)\n   - Icteric sclera and skin\n   - Right upper quadrant tenderness\n\n2. **Laboratory Findings**:\n   - Leukocytosis (16,500/mm3) suggests infection or inflammation.\n   - Elevated total bilirubin (2.8 mg/dL) indicates jaundice.\n   - Mildly elevated liver enzymes (AST 50 U/L, ALT 65 U/L, ALP 180 U/L) suggest some hepatic involvement.\n   - Elevated BUN (30 mg/dL) and slightly elevated serum creatinine (1.2 mg/dL) suggest possible renal impairment.\n   \n3. **Imaging**:\n   - Ultrasound shows a dilated common bile duct, which indicates an obstruction.\n\n4. **Clinical Context**:\n   - The combination of fever, leukocytosis, jaundice, and a dilated common bile duct strongly suggests cholangitis, likely due to an obstructive cause such as choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stones).\n\n5. **Management**:\n   - The patient has been stabilized somewhat with intravenous fluids, dopamine, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the presence of a dilated common bile duct indicates ongoing obstruction that must be relieved.\n   - **ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography)** is the best next step because it is both diagnostic and therapeutic. It can confirm the presence of stones or other obstructive pathologies and allow for immediate intervention such as stone removal or stent placement.\n\nOther options:\n- **MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography)**: This is a non-invasive imaging technique to visualize biliary and pancreatic ducts but is purely diagnostic and not therapeutic.\n- **Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram**: This is more invasive and typically used when ERCP is not possible.\n- **CT abdomen**: This can help visualize the abdomen but is not useful for immediate therapeutic intervention in the context of cholangitis.\n\nGiven the need for immediate therapeutic intervention to relieve the obstruction, the best next step is:\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
