{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of headache, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain for the past 4 days. He smokes 2 packs per day and drinks 2\u20133 beers every day. He denies any previous medical problems except for seasonal allergies for which he takes diphenhydramine on occasions. On physical exam, he is thin and poorly kept. His clothes appear dirty. Small scars are visible in the decubitus region of both arms. The lung sounds are equal with bilateral crackles, and heart auscultation reveals a systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla. Petechiae are seen on the hard palate and palms of his hands. A chest X-ray and blood cultures are ordered. What is the most likely organism causing his symptoms?\nA. Streptococci viridans\nB. Staphylococcus aureus\nC. Aspergillus fumigatus\nD. Staphylococcus epidermidis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely organism causing this patient's symptoms, let's analyze the clinical presentation step-by-step.\n\n1. **Patient's Symptoms and History**:\n   - **Headache, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain**: These symptoms suggest a respiratory or systemic infection.\n   - **Smoking and alcohol use**: These can increase susceptibility to infections.\n   - **Small scars in the decubitus region of both arms**: This indicates possible intravenous drug use.\n\n2. **Physical Exam Findings**:\n   - **Thin and poorly kept appearance with dirty clothes**: This suggests possible neglect or substance abuse.\n   - **Bilateral crackles in the lung sounds**: Suggests possible pneumonia or pulmonary involvement.\n   - **Systolic murmur radiating to the left axilla**: This is indicative of a valvular heart issue, likely endocarditis.\n   - **Petechiae on the hard palate and palms**: These are signs of systemic emboli, often seen in endocarditis.\n\n3. **Most Likely Diagnosis**:\n   - The combination of a systolic murmur, petechiae, and a history suggesting intravenous drug use strongly points towards infective endocarditis.\n\n4. **Likely Causative Organism**:\n   - **Streptococci viridans**: Commonly associated with subacute endocarditis, particularly in patients with pre-existing valvular heart disease.\n   - **Staphylococcus aureus**: Frequently causes acute endocarditis, especially in intravenous drug users.\n   - **Aspergillus fumigatus**: Typically associated with fungal infections, not common in endocarditis.\n   - **Staphylococcus epidermidis**: Usually associated with prosthetic valve endocarditis or device-related infections.\n\nGiven the patient's history of intravenous drug use, acute presentation, and the presence of systemic emboli, the most likely organism causing his symptoms is **Staphylococcus aureus**.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
