{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of headache, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain for the past 4 days. He smokes 2 packs per day and drinks 2\u20133 beers every day. He denies any previous medical problems except for seasonal allergies for which he takes diphenhydramine on occasions. At the hospital, the vital signs include: temperature 40.0\u00b0C (104.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 140/80 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 28/min. On physical exam, he is thin and poorly kept. His clothes appear dirty. Small scars are visible in the decubitus region of both arms. The lung sounds are equal with bilateral crackles, and heart auscultation reveals a systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla. Petechiae are seen on the hard palate and palms of his hands. What is the most likely organism causing his symptoms?\nA. Streptococci viridans\nB. Staphylococcus aureus\nC. Aspergillus fumigatus\nD. Staphylococcus epidermidis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and presentation in detail:\n\n1. **Symptoms**: The patient has a headache, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain for the past 4 days. These are indicative of a significant infection.\n\n2. **Vital Signs**: The patient has a high fever (40.0\u00b0C or 104.0\u00b0F), elevated blood pressure (140/80 mm Hg), increased heart rate (98/min), and increased respiratory rate (28/min). These signs further support a serious infection.\n\n3. **Physical Exam**: The physical exam reveals:\n   - Poor appearance and thin build, suggesting possible chronic illness or substance abuse.\n   - Small scars in the decubitus region of both arms, indicating possible intravenous drug use (IVDU).\n   - Lung sounds with bilateral crackles, suggesting possible pneumonia or other lung infection.\n   - A systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla, which is significant and suggests endocarditis.\n   - Petechiae on the hard palate and palms, which are classic signs of septic emboli, often associated with infective endocarditis.\n\n4. **Risk Factors**: The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use, along with the physical signs of possible IVDU, put him at high risk for infective endocarditis.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is infective endocarditis. The most common organisms causing infective endocarditis in intravenous drug users are:\n\n- **Staphylococcus aureus**: This is the most common cause of infective endocarditis in IVDU patients.\n- **Streptococci viridans**: This is more commonly associated with endocarditis in individuals with preexisting valvular abnormalities or dental procedures but is less common in IVDU.\n- **Staphylococcus epidermidis**: Typically associated with prosthetic valve endocarditis rather than IVDU.\n- **Aspergillus fumigatus**: This is a fungal pathogen and less common in this context.\n\nBased on the clinical presentation and the patient's risk factors, the most likely causative organism is **Staphylococcus aureus**.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
