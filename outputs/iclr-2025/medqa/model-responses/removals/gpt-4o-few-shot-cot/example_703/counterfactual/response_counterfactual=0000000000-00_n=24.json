{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of headache, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain for the past 4 days. He smokes 2 packs per day and drinks 2\u20133 beers every day. He denies any previous medical problems except for seasonal allergies for which he takes diphenhydramine on occasions. At the hospital, the vital signs include: temperature 40.0\u00b0C (104.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 140/80 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 28/min. On physical exam, he is thin and poorly kept. His clothes appear dirty. Small scars are visible in the decubitus region of both arms. The lung sounds are equal with bilateral crackles. Petechiae are seen on the hard palate and palms of his hands. A chest X-ray and blood cultures are ordered. What is the most likely organism causing his symptoms?\nA. Streptococci viridans\nB. Staphylococcus aureus\nC. Aspergillus fumigatus\nD. Staphylococcus epidermidis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely causative organism in this patient's case, we must carefully analyze the clinical presentation and key findings. Here are the important pieces of information:\n\n- The patient has a fever, headache, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain for the past 4 days.\n- He has a smoking history and drinks alcohol regularly.\n- On physical examination, he has a high fever (40.0\u00b0C), elevated heart rate (98/min), and increased respiratory rate (28/min).\n- He has bilateral crackles on lung auscultation, indicating a possible pulmonary infection.\n- He has small scars in the decubitus region of both arms, which could suggest intravenous drug use.\n- Petechiae on the hard palate and palms are noted, suggesting a potential systemic infection or endocarditis.\n\nGiven the combination of bilateral crackles (suggestive of pneumonia or another lung infection) and petechiae (suggestive of a systemic infection such as endocarditis), we should consider common pathogens associated with these conditions, especially in the context of potential intravenous drug use.\n\n1. **Streptococci viridans**: This group of bacteria is often associated with subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in patients with pre-existing heart conditions. However, it is less commonly associated with acute presentations and pulmonary findings in this context.\n\n2. **Staphylococcus aureus**: This bacterium is a common cause of both acute bacterial endocarditis and pneumonia, particularly in individuals with a history of intravenous drug use. It can present acutely and is known for causing severe systemic infections, which aligns with the patient's presentation.\n\n3. **Aspergillus fumigatus**: This is a fungal pathogen that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals and is less likely to cause acute systemic symptoms in an otherwise healthy individual.\n\n4. **Staphylococcus epidermidis**: This bacterium is typically associated with indwelling medical devices and is a common cause of nosocomial infections but is less likely to cause acute systemic symptoms and pulmonary findings in this context.\n\nBased on the clinical presentation, including acute symptoms, potential intravenous drug use, and findings suggestive of systemic infection, the most likely causative organism is:\n\nAnswer: B. Staphylococcus aureus", "answer": "B"}
