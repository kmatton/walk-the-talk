{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and \u2018bruising on his feet\u2019. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. Patient\u2019s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?\nA. Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months\nB. Elective endovascular repair\nC. Elective open surgical repair\nD. Emergency open surgical repair\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the best course of treatment for this patient, it's important to consider the specifics of the patient's condition, including the size and stability of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, as well as the patient's overall health and risk factors.\n\n1. **Patient Presentation and History**:\n   - The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and transient ischemic attacks.\n   - Symptoms include abdominal pain and bruising on the feet.\n   - Significant smoking and alcohol use history.\n   - Current medications include sildenafil.\n   - Vitals: BP 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.\n\n2. **Diagnostic Findings**:\n   - Abdominal ultrasound and contrast CT reveal an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a diameter of 4.1 cm.\n   - The aneurysm is small and unruptured.\n   - Abdominal pain is mild to moderate and dull, localized to the umbilical region, and the abdomen is soft and nontender.\n   - Physical examination shows bruising on the feet, which may suggest embolization from the aneurysm.\n\n3. **Medical Management**:\n   - High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation initiated.\n   - Morphine sulfate and metoprolol have been administered.\n\n### Analyzing Treatment Options:\n\n- **Option A: Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months**\n  - Typically recommended for asymptomatic small AAAs (<5.5 cm) that are stable and not causing significant symptoms.\n\n- **Option B: Elective endovascular repair**\n  - Considered for AAAs that are symptomatic or rapidly enlarging, even if they are less than 5.5 cm in diameter. Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, this could be a suitable option.\n\n- **Option C: Elective open surgical repair**\n  - Usually reserved for larger AAAs or when endovascular repair is not feasible. Given the current size of the aneurysm (4.1 cm) and lack of rupture, this seems less likely to be immediately necessary.\n\n- **Option D: Emergency open surgical repair**\n  - Indicated for ruptured AAAs or in cases of imminent rupture. The patient's AAA is currently unruptured and stable, making this option less relevant at this time.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the presence of symptoms (abdominal pain and foot bruising suggestive of embolization) and the size of the AAA (4.1 cm), elective endovascular repair (Option B) is the most appropriate course of action to prevent potential complications.\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
