{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions.

The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient\u2019s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?\nA. Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months\nB. Elective endovascular repair\nC. Elective open surgical repair\nD. Emergency open surgical repair\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the information provided in the case step-by-step:\n\n1. **Patient's Profile and History**:\n   - 69-year-old male with hypertension and high cholesterol.\n   - History of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).\n   - 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use.\n   - Current medication: sildenafil.\n   - Symptoms: abdominal pain, bruising on feet, decreased appetite, feeling easily full.\n   - Physical exam: alert, cooperative, carotid bruit on the right, abdomen soft and nontender, pulsatile abdominal mass in the lower umbilical region.\n\n2. **Vital Signs**:\n   - Temperature: 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F)\n   - Blood pressure: 155/89 mm Hg\n   - Pulse: 89/min\n   - Respirations: 16/min\n   - Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air\n\n3. **Investigations**:\n   - Abdominal ultrasound: reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\n   - Contrast CT: small, unruptured AAA with a diameter of 4.1 cm.\n\n4. **Key Points**:\n   - The AAA is unruptured and measures 4.1 cm in diameter.\n   - The patient has symptoms but no immediate signs of rupture or severe complication requiring emergency intervention.\n\n5. **Treatment Options**:\n   - **Option A: Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months**:\n     - Indicated for small AAAs (usually <5.5 cm in diameter) without acute symptoms or complications.\n   - **Option B: Elective endovascular repair**:\n     - Considered for symptomatic or larger AAAs, typically when the diameter is >5.5 cm or if there are symptoms indicating potential complications.\n   - **Option C: Elective open surgical repair**:\n     - Considered for larger AAAs or symptomatic AAAs in patients who are good surgical candidates.\n   - **Option D: Emergency open surgical repair**:\n     - Indicated for ruptured AAAs or those with imminent risk of rupture.\n\nGiven the diameter of the AAA (4.1 cm) and the absence of acute symptoms or signs of rupture, the best course of action is to monitor the patient with regular follow-up and imaging.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
