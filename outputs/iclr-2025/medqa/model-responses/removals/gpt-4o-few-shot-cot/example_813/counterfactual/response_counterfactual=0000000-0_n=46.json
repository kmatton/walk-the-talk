{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was \u201cpretty cold\u201d in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?\nA. Lisinopril\nB. Fluphenazine\nC. Levothyroxine\nD. Atorvastatin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, let's analyze his history and presentation step-by-step.\n\n1. **History and Symptoms**:\n   - Altered mental status, lethargy, and confusion.\n   - History of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.\n   - Recently started a new drug 10 days ago.\n   - Physical examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes and 1+ reflexes in the upper extremities. Pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. The patient is attempting to remove his clothing.\n\n2. **Possible Drug Side Effects**:\n   - **Lisinopril**: An ACE inhibitor used for hypertension. Side effects usually include cough, hyperkalemia, and angioedema, but not the symptoms described here.\n   - **Fluphenazine**: An antipsychotic medication used for schizoaffective disorder. It can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which presents with altered mental status, autonomic instability, muscle rigidity, and hyperreflexia. However, hypothermia and dilated pupils are less common.\n   - **Levothyroxine**: Used to treat hypothyroidism. Overdose can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism but not typically the neurologic symptoms presented.\n   - **Atorvastatin**: A statin used for dyslipidemia. Side effects usually include muscle pain and liver enzyme abnormalities, not the neurologic symptoms presented here.\n\n3. **Suspicion of Drug-Induced Hypothermia and Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)**:\n   - The patient\u2019s hypothermia (cold apartment, windows open), altered mental status, autonomic dysregulation (attempting to remove clothing), and muscle weakness with absent reflexes are suggestive of a severe adverse drug reaction.\n   - The dilated and poorly reactive pupils, alongside the new drug initiation 10 days ago, point towards an antipsychotic drug like Fluphenazine, which can cause severe side effects including NMS.\n\nGiven the context, the most likely cause of these findings is the recent initiation of Fluphenazine, which has side effects consistent with the patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
