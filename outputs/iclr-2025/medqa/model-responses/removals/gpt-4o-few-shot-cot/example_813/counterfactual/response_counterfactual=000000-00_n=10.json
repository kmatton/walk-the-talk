{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was \u201cpretty cold\u201d in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?\nA. Lisinopril\nB. Fluphenazine\nC. Levothyroxine\nD. Atorvastatin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze this patient's symptoms and history step-by-step:\n\n1. **Hypothermia (rectal temperature 32\u00b0C or 89.6\u00b0F):** This is a significant drop in body temperature.\n2. **Bradycardia (pulse 54/min):** A slower than normal heart rate.\n3. **Altered mental status and lethargy:** Indicates central nervous system involvement.\n4. **Respiratory depression (respirations 8/min):** Reduced breathing rate.\n5. **Neurological findings:** Weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes and 1+ reflexes in the upper extremities. Pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light.\n6. **Behavioral symptoms:** Attempts to remove clothing despite being cold (paradoxical undressing, a symptom sometimes seen in severe hypothermia).\n\nGiven the history of hypothyroidism and the current presentation, these findings suggest a possible myxedema coma, which is a severe form of hypothyroidism. However, the acute onset and specific neurological findings point towards another cause related to medication.\n\nConsidering the patient's medications:\n- **Lisinopril:** An ACE inhibitor for hypertension, unlikely to cause these symptoms.\n- **Fluphenazine:** An antipsychotic for schizoaffective disorder, which can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). However, NMS typically presents with hyperthermia, not hypothermia, and hyperreflexia rather than absent reflexes.\n- **Levothyroxine:** A thyroid hormone replacement, which is unlikely to cause these acute symptoms if taken correctly.\n- **Atorvastatin:** A statin for dyslipidemia, which is also unlikely to cause these symptoms.\n\nThe antipsychotic **Fluphenazine** is known to potentially cause severe side effects including hypothermia, altered mental status, and autonomic instability, especially if the patient is exposed to cold environments, as the father mentioned (\"pretty cold\" apartment).\n\nThus, considering the symptoms and the medication side effects, the most likely cause is:\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
