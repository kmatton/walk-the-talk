{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning. The father also noticed it was \u201cpretty cold\u201d in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?\nA. Lisinopril\nB. Fluphenazine\nC. Levothyroxine\nD. Atorvastatin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's break down the details of the patient's presentation and analyze the potential causes based on his symptoms and recent medication change.\n\n1. **Hypothermia**: The patient's rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), which is significantly low, indicating hypothermia.\n2. **Lethargy and Altered Mental Status**: The patient is lethargic and has altered mental status.\n3. **Bradycardia and Hypoventilation**: Pulse is 54/min and respirations are 8/min, both of which are lower than normal.\n4. **Neurological Findings**: Weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes and 1+ reflexes in the upper extremities. Pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light.\n5. **Behavioral Changes**: The patient is attempting to remove his clothing, which can be a sign of confusion or discomfort.\n\nGiven the patient's medical history and the recent medication change, we need to consider which medication could cause this combination of symptoms.\n\n- **Lisinopril**: This is an ACE inhibitor used for hypertension. It is not typically associated with the neurological or thermoregulatory symptoms described.\n- **Fluphenazine**: This is an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizoaffective disorder. Antipsychotics, particularly first-generation ones like fluphenazine, can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which can present with hypothermia, altered mental status, bradycardia, and muscle rigidity or weakness.\n- **Levothyroxine**: This is a thyroid hormone replacement used for hypothyroidism. Overdose can cause hyperthyroid symptoms, while undertreatment can cause hypothyroid symptoms, but these are not consistent with the acute presentation described.\n- **Atorvastatin**: This is a statin used for dyslipidemia, and is not associated with the acute symptoms described.\n\nConsidering the patient's recent medication change and the symptoms presented, the most likely cause is:\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
