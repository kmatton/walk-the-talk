{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning. The father also noticed it was \u201cpretty cold\u201d in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?\nA. Lisinopril\nB. Fluphenazine\nC. Levothyroxine\nD. Atorvastatin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine which drug is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, let's analyze the case:\n\n1. **Patient History and Symptoms**:\n   - **Altered mental status**: This can be attributed to several conditions, including medication side effects.\n   - **Unable to get out of bed**: Suggests severe lethargy or weakness.\n   - **Cold environment**: Could exacerbate any underlying conditions.\n   - **Hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension**: These conditions and their treatments need to be considered.\n   - **New drug started 10 days ago**: This is a critical clue.\n\n2. **Physical Examination**:\n   - **Rectal temperature of 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F)**: Indicates hypothermia.\n   - **Pulse 54/min**: Bradycardia, which can be associated with hypothyroidism or certain medications.\n   - **Respirations 8/min**: Hypoventilation or respiratory depression.\n   - **Blood pressure 122/80 mm Hg**: Normal blood pressure.\n   - **Weakness in lower extremities, absent deep tendon reflexes**: May indicate severe hypothyroidism.\n   - **Dilated pupils, poorly reactive to light**: Could be due to central nervous system depression.\n   - **Attempting to remove clothing**: Suggests altered mental state or confusion.\n\n3. **Medications**:\n   - **Lisinopril**: An ACE inhibitor, generally not associated with these symptoms.\n   - **Fluphenazine**: An antipsychotic, which can cause extrapyramidal symptoms but not typically hypothermia and bradycardia.\n   - **Levothyroxine**: Used to treat hypothyroidism. Not likely to cause these symptoms unless overdosed, which would cause hyperthyroid symptoms instead.\n   - **Atorvastatin**: A statin, not typically associated with these symptoms.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The patient's symptoms of hypothermia, bradycardia, and severe lethargy are consistent with hypothyroidism or a medication that can exacerbate hypothyroid symptoms.\n   - Fluphenazine, a typical antipsychotic, can sometimes cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or exacerbate symptoms of hypothyroidism, particularly in a patient with pre-existing hypothyroidism.\n\n**Based on the above analysis, Fluphenazine is the most likely drug causing these symptoms.**\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
