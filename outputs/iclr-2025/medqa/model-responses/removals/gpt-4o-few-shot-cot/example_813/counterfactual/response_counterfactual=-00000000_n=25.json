{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was \u201cpretty cold\u201d in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?\nA. Lisinopril\nB. Fluphenazine\nC. Levothyroxine\nD. Atorvastatin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the patient's presentation and medication history to determine the most likely cause of his symptoms.\n\n1. **Altered Mental Status and Lethargy**: The patient presents with confusion and lethargy, which are nonspecific but significant findings.\n\n2. **Vital Signs**: The patient's rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), indicating hypothermia. He also has bradycardia (pulse 54/min) and hypoventilation (respirations 8/min). His blood pressure is within the normal range.\n\n3. **Neurological Findings**: The patient has weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes and 1+ reflexes in the upper extremities. His pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light, and he is attempting to remove his clothing throughout the examination.\n\n4. **Recent Medication Change**: The patient was started on a new medication 10 days ago. Given his history of schizoaffective disorder, the new medication is likely related to his psychiatric condition.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and recent medication change, the most likely cause is a drug-induced condition.\n\n- **Lisinopril**: This is an ACE inhibitor used for hypertension. It is not typically associated with hypothermia, altered mental status, or the neurological findings observed.\n- **Fluphenazine**: This is an antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Neuroleptic-induced hypothermia is a well-documented side effect of antipsychotic medications, particularly those with potent dopamine antagonism like fluphenazine. The lethargy, bradycardia, hypoventilation, and abnormal pupil response are consistent with side effects of antipsychotics.\n- **Levothyroxine**: This is used to treat hypothyroidism. While improper dosing can cause symptoms, it is less likely to cause the acute presentation seen here.\n- **Atorvastatin**: This is used for dyslipidemia. It is not typically associated with the severe neurological and systemic symptoms described.\n\nGiven the patient's clinical presentation and recent initiation of a new antipsychotic medication, the most likely cause is:\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
