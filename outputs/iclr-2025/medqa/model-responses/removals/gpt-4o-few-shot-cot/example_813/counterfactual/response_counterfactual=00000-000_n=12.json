{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was \u201cpretty cold\u201d in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?\nA. Lisinopril\nB. Fluphenazine\nC. Levothyroxine\nD. Atorvastatin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the case step-by-step to identify the most likely cause of the patient's altered mental status and other symptoms.\n\n1. **Symptoms and Signs:**\n   - **Altered mental status**: Confusion and lethargy.\n   - **Unable to get out of bed**: Suggestive of significant weakness.\n   - **Hypothermia**: Rectal temperature of 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F).\n   - **Bradycardia**: Pulse of 54/min.\n   - **Hypoventilation**: Respirations of 8/min.\n   - **Normal blood pressure**: 122/80 mm Hg.\n   - **Neurological findings**: Weakness in lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes; 1+ deep tendon reflexes in upper extremities; dilated and poorly reactive pupils.\n   - **Behavior**: Attempting to remove clothing, which can be a sign of confusion or altered mental status.\n\n2. **History and Context:**\n   - The patient was started on a new drug 10 days ago.\n   - The father noticed the apartment was cold with windows open, suggesting possible exposure to cold, which could exacerbate hypothermia but is not the primary cause given the significant bradycardia and hypoventilation.\n\n3. **Differential Diagnosis:**\n   - **Lisinopril**: This is an ACE inhibitor used for hypertension and heart failure. It does not typically cause hypothermia, bradycardia, or severe neurological symptoms.\n   - **Fluphenazine**: This is a typical antipsychotic. It can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), but NMS usually presents with hyperthermia, not hypothermia, and muscle rigidity rather than weakness.\n   - **Levothyroxine**: This is a thyroid hormone replacement. An overdose could theoretically cause hyperthyroid symptoms, which do not match the patient's presentation.\n   - **Atorvastatin**: This is a statin used to lower cholesterol. It does not typically cause hypothermia, bradycardia, or severe neurological symptoms.\n\n4. **Most Likely Diagnosis:**\n   - The patient\u2019s symptoms are more consistent with **hypothyroidism** (myxedema coma), a severe form of hypothyroidism. The symptoms of hypothermia, bradycardia, hypoventilation, lethargy, and altered mental status fit well with this diagnosis.\n   - The initiation of a new drug 10 days ago could be a misleading factor, but considering the symptoms and the most plausible cause, it aligns more with hypothyroidism rather than a side effect of Lisinopril, Fluphenazine, or Atorvastatin.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most likely cause of these findings is hypothyroidism (myxedema coma), and the drug most consistent with causing hypothyroidism symptoms is the cessation of thyroid hormone replacement, not initiation. However, the context suggests that the new drug may be irrelevant, and the focus should be on the symptoms aligning with severe hypothyroidism.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
