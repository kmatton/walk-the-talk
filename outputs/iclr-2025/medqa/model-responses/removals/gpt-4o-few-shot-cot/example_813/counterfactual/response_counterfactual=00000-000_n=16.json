{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was \u201cpretty cold\u201d in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?\nA. Lisinopril\nB. Fluphenazine\nC. Levothyroxine\nD. Atorvastatin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and history step-by-step:\n\n1. **Altered Mental Status:** The patient has confusion and lethargy, which suggests a central nervous system effect.\n2. **Hypothermia:** The rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), indicating significant hypothermia.\n3. **Bradycardia:** The pulse is 54/min, which is slower than normal.\n4. **Hypoventilation:** The respirations are 8/min, which is below the normal range.\n5. **Neurologic Findings:** The patient has weakness and absent deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities, with poorly reactive dilated pupils.\n\nGiven these symptoms, let's consider the possible effects of each drug:\n\nA. **Lisinopril:** This drug is an ACE inhibitor used for hypertension, and it is unlikely to cause the severe neurological and hypothermic symptoms described.\n\nB. **Fluphenazine:** This antipsychotic can cause extrapyramidal symptoms, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which can include altered mental status, autonomic instability, and muscle rigidity. However, hypothermia is atypical for NMS, which more commonly presents with hyperthermia.\n\nC. **Levothyroxine:** This drug is used to treat hypothyroidism. The symptoms described (hypothermia, bradycardia, hypoventilation, and altered mental status) are consistent with severe hypothyroidism or myxedema coma, but this would be an unlikely reaction to starting levothyroxine unless the patient was severely overdosed, which is not suggested in the history.\n\nD. **Atorvastatin:** This statin is used to lower cholesterol and is not associated with the severe neurological or autonomic symptoms described.\n\nGiven the patient's significant hypothermia, bradycardia, hypoventilation, and the timing with the initiation of a new drug, the most likely cause is **Fluphenazine**, as it can lead to severe reactions impacting the central nervous system and autonomic function.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
