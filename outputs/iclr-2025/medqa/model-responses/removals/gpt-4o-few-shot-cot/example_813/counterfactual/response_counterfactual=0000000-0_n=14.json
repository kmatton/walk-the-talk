{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was \u201cpretty cold\u201d in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?\nA. Lisinopril\nB. Fluphenazine\nC. Levothyroxine\nD. Atorvastatin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely drug causing the patient's symptoms, we need to consider his medical history, recent medication changes, and clinical presentation.\n\n1. **History and Symptoms**: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Recently, he started a new medication 10 days ago. He is now presenting with altered mental status, lethargy, weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes, dilated and poorly reactive pupils, and hypothermia.\n\n2. **Possible Drug Side Effects**:\n   - **Lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor)**: Commonly used for hypertension and can cause side effects such as cough, hyperkalemia, and angioedema, but these do not align with the patient's presentation.\n   - **Fluphenazine (an antipsychotic)**: Used for schizoaffective disorder. It can cause extrapyramidal symptoms and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which includes altered mental status, autonomic instability, hyperthermia, and muscle rigidity. However, hypothermia and absent deep tendon reflexes are not typical for NMS.\n   - **Levothyroxine (thyroid hormone replacement)**: Used for hypothyroidism. Symptoms of overdose include hyperthyroid symptoms like palpitations, insomnia, and increased appetite, none of which match this patient's presentation.\n   - **Atorvastatin (a statin)**: Used for dyslipidemia. Side effects can include myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, which can cause muscle weakness and pain, but these are not typically associated with altered mental status and hypothermia.\n\n3. **Cold Exposure and Hypothermia**: The patient's hypothermia is significant, considering the open windows and the cold apartment. This hypothermia, combined with altered mental status and muscle weakness, suggests a possible adverse drug reaction or a condition exacerbated by the cold.\n\n4. **Poorly Reactive Pupils and Neurological Symptoms**: The combination of dilated, poorly reactive pupils and diminished reflexes suggests a central nervous system effect, which can be seen with certain psychiatric medications.\n\nGiven these considerations, **Fluphenazine** stands out as the most likely culprit because antipsychotic medications, especially first-generation ones like fluphenazine, can cause severe side effects, including autonomic dysregulation which can lead to hypothermia and altered mental status, particularly in a patient exposed to cold.\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
