{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus.

According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning. The father also noticed it was \u201cpretty cold\u201d in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?\nA. Lisinopril\nB. Fluphenazine\nC. Levothyroxine\nD. Atorvastatin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, we need to carefully analyze the patient's symptoms and his recent medication history.\n\n### Symptoms:\n- Altered mental status \n- Hypothermia (rectal temperature of 32\u00b0C)\n- Bradycardia (pulse 54/min)\n- Respiratory depression (respirations 8/min)\n- Hypotonia (weakness in lower extremities, absent deep tendon reflexes, and 1+ in upper extremities)\n- Dilated pupils poorly reactive to light\n- Attempting to remove clothing (which can be a sign of confusion or altered mental state)\n\n### Medical History:\n- Hypothyroidism\n- Schizoaffective disorder\n- Type 2 diabetes mellitus\n- Dyslipidemia\n- Hypertension\n\n### Recent Medication:\n- Started on a new drug 10 days ago\n\n### Potential Drug Causes:\n- **A. Lisinopril**: An ACE inhibitor used for hypertension. It is not typically associated with the described symptoms.\n- **B. Fluphenazine**: An antipsychotic used for schizoaffective disorder. It can cause extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), and hypothermia.\n- **C. Levothyroxine**: A thyroid hormone replacement for hypothyroidism. Symptoms of overdose include tachycardia and hyperthermia, not hypothermia.\n- **D. Atorvastatin**: A statin used for dyslipidemia. It is not typically associated with the described symptoms.\n\n### Analysis:\nGiven the patient's history of schizoaffective disorder and the onset of symptoms following the introduction of a new medication, it is likely that the new medication is fluphenazine. The symptoms described, especially hypothermia, bradycardia, respiratory depression, and altered mental status, are consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medications like fluphenazine.\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
