{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 76-year-old is brought to the physician by his wife because of low back pain and weakness for the past 4 weeks. He says that the pain is sharp, radiates to his left side, and has a burning quality. He has had a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months. He has had 3.2-kg (7.0-lb) weight loss in that time. He is now unable to walk without assistance and has had constipation and difficulty urinating for the past 2 weeks. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Neurologic examination shows 3/5 strength of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexive. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?\nA. Radiation therapy\nB. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy\nC. Intravenous acyclovir therapy\nD. Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To answer this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and findings step-by-step:\n\n1. **Patient History and Symptoms**:\n   - Age: 76 years old.\n   - Low back pain and weakness for 4 weeks.\n   - Pain is sharp, radiates to the left side, and has a burning quality.\n   - Cough with blood-streaked sputum for 2 months.\n   - Weight loss of 3.2 kg (7.0 lbs) over 2 months.\n   - Constipation and difficulty urinating for 2 weeks.\n   - Past medical history: Hypertension treated with enalapril.\n   - Significant smoking history: 1 pack/day for 60 years.\n\n2. **Physical Examination**:\n   - Neurologic examination: 3/5 strength in the lower extremities, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign bilaterally.\n   - Sensory examination: Decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome.\n   - Unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain.\n\n3. **Radiology**:\n   - Chest x-ray shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs.\n\n**Diagnosis Consideration**:\n- The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are concerning for metastatic cancer, with likely primary lung cancer given the significant smoking history and presence of lung opacities.\n- Neurological signs (weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, sensory deficits) suggest spinal cord compression, likely due to metastatic deposits in the vertebrae.\n\n**Management**:\n- The immediate concern is to relieve spinal cord compression to prevent further neurological deterioration.\n- **Radiation therapy (A)** is a common treatment for spinal cord compression due to metastases, but it is not the immediate next step.\n- **Intravenous dexamethasone therapy (B)** is the immediate next step to reduce inflammation and edema around the spinal cord and relieve compression.\n\n**Other options**:\n- **Intravenous acyclovir therapy (C)** is used for viral infections like herpes zoster, which is not indicated here.\n- **Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy (D)** is used for bacterial infections like pneumonia, which is not the primary concern here.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to administer intravenous dexamethasone to reduce spinal cord compression.\n\n**Answer**: B", "answer": "B"}
