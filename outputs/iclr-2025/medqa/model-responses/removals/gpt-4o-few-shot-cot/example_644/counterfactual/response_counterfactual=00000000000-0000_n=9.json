{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 76-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of low back pain and weakness for the past 4 weeks. He says that the pain is sharp, radiates to his left side, and has a burning quality. He has had a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months. He has had 3.2-kg (7.0-lb) weight loss in that time. He is now unable to walk without assistance and has had constipation and difficulty urinating for the past 2 weeks. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Neurologic examination shows 3/5 strength of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexive. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?\nA. Radiation therapy\nB. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy\nC. Intravenous acyclovir therapy\nD. Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "The patient's presentation of progressive back pain, weakness, weight loss, hemoptysis, and a significant smoking history, combined with imaging that shows multiple pulmonary nodules, suggests a diagnosis of metastatic cancer, likely lung cancer with spinal cord compression. The decreased sensation below the T4 dermatome, hyperreflexia, and positive Babinski sign support spinal cord involvement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the symptoms and signs**:\n   - Progressive low back pain and weakness\n   - Radiating sharp, burning pain\n   - Hemoptysis\n   - Weight loss\n   - Constipation and difficulty urinating\n   - Lower extremity weakness (3/5 strength)\n   - Hyperreflexive deep tendon reflexes\n   - Positive Babinski sign\n   - Decreased sensation below the T4 dermatome\n\n2. **Review the patient's history and examination findings**:\n   - Significant smoking history\n   - Presence of multiple round opacities in the lungs (likely metastatic lesions)\n\n3. **Consider the differential diagnosis**:\n   - Metastatic lung cancer with spinal cord compression\n\n4. **Determine the most urgent management step**:\n   - Spinal cord compression is an emergency. The goal is to reduce inflammation and edema around the spinal cord to relieve compression and prevent further damage.\n\n5. **Treatment options**:\n   - **Radiation therapy (A)**: Effective for localized control of metastatic lesions but not the immediate first step.\n   - **Intravenous dexamethasone therapy (B)**: Used to reduce spinal cord inflammation and edema rapidly.\n   - **Intravenous acyclovir therapy (C)**: Indicated for viral infections like herpes zoster, which is not suggested here.\n   - **Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy (D)**: Indicated for bacterial infections like pneumonia, which is not the primary concern.\n\nThe most appropriate immediate management step is to administer intravenous dexamethasone to reduce spinal cord compression and inflammation.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
