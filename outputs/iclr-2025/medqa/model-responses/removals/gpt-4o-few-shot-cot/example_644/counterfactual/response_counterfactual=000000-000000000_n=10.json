{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 76-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of low back pain and weakness for the past 4 weeks. He says that the pain is sharp, radiates to his left side, and has a burning quality. He has had a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months. He is now unable to walk without assistance and has had constipation and difficulty urinating for the past 2 weeks. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Neurologic examination shows 3/5 strength of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexive. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?\nA. Radiation therapy\nB. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy\nC. Intravenous acyclovir therapy\nD. Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "The patient presents with several concerning symptoms: low back pain, weakness, blood-streaked sputum, and neurologic signs including decreased strength, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and sensory loss below the T4 dermatome. These findings suggest a possible spinal cord compression, likely due to metastatic cancer given the history of smoking and multiple lung opacities.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Symptoms and History**:\n   - Sharp, radiating low back pain with a burning quality.\n   - Productive cough with blood-streaked sputum for 2 months.\n   - Weakness, difficulty walking, constipation, and urinary retention.\n   - Significant smoking history (1 pack per day for 60 years).\n   - Neurologic signs: 3/5 strength in lower extremities, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign, decreased sensation below T4 dermatome.\n\n2. **Clinical Findings Consistent with Spinal Cord Compression**:\n   - The neurological deficits (weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign) suggest upper motor neuron involvement.\n   - The sensory level at T4 indicates a possible thoracic spinal cord lesion.\n\n3. **Chest X-ray**:\n   - Shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs, suggesting metastatic disease, likely from a primary lung carcinoma.\n\n4. **Most Immediate Concern**:\n   - Spinal cord compression is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention to prevent permanent damage.\n\n### Treatment Options:\n\n- **A. Radiation therapy**: This can be part of the treatment for metastatic spinal cord compression but is not the immediate next step.\n- **B. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy**: This is used to reduce inflammation and edema around the spinal cord, providing immediate relief and stabilization before further definitive treatment like surgery or radiation.\n- **C. Intravenous acyclovir therapy**: This is used for viral infections, not applicable here.\n- **D. Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy**: This combination is used for bacterial infections, not applicable here.\n\nGiven the urgent need to address the spinal cord compression and the inflammatory response associated with it, the most appropriate immediate step is intravenous dexamethasone therapy.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
