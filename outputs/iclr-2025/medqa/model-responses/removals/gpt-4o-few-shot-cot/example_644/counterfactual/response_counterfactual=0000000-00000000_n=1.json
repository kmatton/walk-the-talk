{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 76-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of low back pain and weakness for the past 4 weeks. He says that the pain is sharp, radiates to his left side, and has a burning quality. He has had a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months. He has had 3.2-kg (7.0-lb) weight loss in that time. He has had constipation and difficulty urinating for the past 2 weeks. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Neurologic examination shows 3/5 strength of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexive. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?\nA. Radiation therapy\nB. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy\nC. Intravenous acyclovir therapy\nD. Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient, let's analyze the clinical presentation and findings step-by-step:\n\n1. **Patient History and Symptoms**:\n   - **Low back pain and weakness for 4 weeks**: Chronic nature of the pain.\n   - **Radiates to the left side, burning quality**: Consistent with nerve involvement.\n   - **Cough with blood-streaked sputum**: Indicates possible lung pathology.\n   - **Weight loss of 3.2 kg over 2 months**: Suggests a systemic illness.\n   - **Constipation and difficulty urinating for 2 weeks**: Signs of possible spinal cord involvement.\n   - **Smoking history**: 1 pack per day for 60 years, high risk for lung cancer.\n\n2. **Examination Findings**:\n   - **Neurologic examination**:\n     - **3/5 strength in lower extremities**: Indicates significant weakness.\n     - **Hyperreflexive deep tendon reflexes and Babinski sign present bilaterally**: Suggest upper motor neuron lesion.\n     - **Decreased sensation below T4 dermatome**: Indicates spinal cord compression at or above this level.\n   - **Unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain**: Severe discomfort.\n\n3. **Imaging Findings**:\n   - **Chest X-ray**: Shows multiple round opacities in both lungs, likely metastatic lesions.\n\nGiven this patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings, it is highly suggestive of metastatic disease with spinal cord compression. Immediate intervention is required to prevent further neurological deterioration.\n\n4. **Management Options**:\n   - **Radiation therapy**: Effective for local control of metastatic lesions but not the immediate first step.\n   - **Intravenous dexamethasone therapy**: Provides rapid reduction of inflammation and edema around the spinal cord, potentially relieving compression.\n   - **Intravenous acyclovir therapy**: Used for viral infections, not indicated here.\n   - **Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy**: Antibiotics for bacterial infections, not indicated here.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nGiven the urgent need to reduce spinal cord compression and inflammation, **intravenous dexamethasone therapy** is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.\n\n**Answer**: B", "answer": "B"}
