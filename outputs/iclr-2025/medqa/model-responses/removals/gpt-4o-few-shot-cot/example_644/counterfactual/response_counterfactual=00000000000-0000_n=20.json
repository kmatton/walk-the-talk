{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 76-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of low back pain and weakness for the past 4 weeks. He says that the pain is sharp, radiates to his left side, and has a burning quality. He has had a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months. He has had 3.2-kg (7.0-lb) weight loss in that time. He is now unable to walk without assistance and has had constipation and difficulty urinating for the past 2 weeks. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Neurologic examination shows 3/5 strength of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexive. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?\nA. Radiation therapy\nB. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy\nC. Intravenous acyclovir therapy\nD. Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "The detailed history and clinical examination of this 76-year-old man suggest a complex clinical picture involving multiple systems. Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Back Pain and Neurological Symptoms:**\n   - Sharp, radiating, burning pain to the left side.\n   - Weakness in the lower extremities, hyperreflexive deep tendon reflexes, and a positive Babinski sign suggest spinal cord compression.\n   - Decreased sensation below the T4 dermatome further indicates a spinal cord issue at the thoracic level.\n\n2. **Systemic Symptoms:**\n   - Weight loss (3.2 kg or 7 lbs over 2 months).\n   - Productive cough with blood-streaked sputum.\n   - History of heavy smoking (1 pack/day for 60 years).\n\n3. **Imaging:**\n   - Chest x-ray reveals multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs, suggestive of metastatic disease.\n\n4. **Current Functional Status:**\n   - Difficulty walking without assistance.\n   - Constipation and difficulty urinating, indicative of possible spinal cord compression impacting autonomic function.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and the finding of potential metastatic lesions in the lungs, this patient's back pain and neurological symptoms are highly likely due to spinal cord compression from metastatic disease.\n\n**Management:**\n- Immediate management of spinal cord compression due to metastatic disease typically involves reducing inflammation and swelling around the spinal cord to prevent further neurological damage.\n- **Intravenous dexamethasone** is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation and edema around the spinal cord, thus providing symptomatic relief and stabilizing the patient for further treatment.\n\nOther options are less appropriate:\n- **Radiation therapy** may be needed but is not the immediate first step.\n- **Intravenous acyclovir therapy** is for viral infections such as herpes and is not relevant here.\n- **Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy** is for bacterial infections and is not indicated based on the provided information.\n\nThus, the most appropriate next step is:\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
