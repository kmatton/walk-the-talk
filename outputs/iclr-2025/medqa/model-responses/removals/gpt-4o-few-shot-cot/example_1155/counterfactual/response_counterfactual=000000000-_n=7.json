The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Galactosemia\nB. Biliary atresia\nC. Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome\nD. Breast milk jaundice\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the information provided to determine the most likely diagnosis.\n\n1. **Symptoms**: Increasing yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), pale stools, and scleral icterus.\n2. **Timeline**: Symptoms have been present for 2 weeks, with stools becoming pale over the past week.\n3. **Feeding history**: The infant was breastfed but then switched to formula recently.\n4. **Physical examination**: Jaundice, scleral icterus, liver palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin, normal vital signs, and normal neurologic examination.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\nA. **Galactosemia**: Typically presents in the first few days of life with jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and failure to thrive. This infant's presentation at 4 weeks and the recent development of pale stools make this less likely.\n\nB. **Biliary atresia**: Characterized by progressive jaundice, pale stools, and hepatomegaly. These symptoms typically develop after 2 weeks of age, which aligns with this infant\u2019s presentation. The presence of pale stools is a key indicator of biliary atresia, as it suggests a problem with bile flow.\n\nC. **Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome**: A rare genetic disorder causing severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. This condition usually presents with severe jaundice and does not typically cause pale stools or hepatomegaly.\n\nD. **Breast milk jaundice**: Typically presents with jaundice in the first 1\u20132 weeks of life, but it usually does not cause pale stools or hepatomegaly.\n\nGiven the presence of pale stools, jaundice, and hepatomegaly, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
