{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 4-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Galactosemia\nB. Biliary atresia\nC. Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome\nD. Breast milk jaundice\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's carefully analyze the given information and options to determine the most likely diagnosis for this 4-week-old female newborn who presents with increasing jaundice, pale stools, and a palpable liver edge.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Symptoms:**\n   - Increasing yellowing of eyes and skin (jaundice) for 2 weeks.\n   - Pale stools over the past week.\n   - Scleral icterus and jaundice present on examination.\n   - The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin.\n   \n2. **Context and History:**\n   - The patient was breastfed initially but switched to formula recently.\n   - Delivered vaginally at 38 weeks with no complications.\n   - Vital signs are normal, and the patient appears healthy otherwise.\n   - She is growing well (50th percentile for length, 60th percentile for weight).\n\n### Differential Diagnosis:\n\nA. **Galactosemia:**\n   - Typically presents in the first few days of life with jaundice, vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, and sometimes an enlarged liver. \n   - The switch to formula (which would be lactose-free in galactosemia cases) would likely improve symptoms if it were galactosemia.\n   \nB. **Biliary atresia:**\n   - Usually presents with jaundice that starts around 2-8 weeks of life.\n   - Pale or acholic stools and hepatomegaly are common.\n   - The progressive jaundice despite switching from breast milk to formula supports biliary atresia.\n\nC. **Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome:**\n   - A rare genetic disorder causing severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n   - Does not typically cause pale stools or hepatomegaly.\n   \nD. **Breast milk jaundice:**\n   - Occurs in breastfed infants and typically peaks at 2-3 weeks of life.\n   - It does not usually cause pale stools or hepatomegaly.\n   - Jaundice often improves with temporary cessation of breastfeeding, but not to the extent described here with a switch to formula.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe presence of prolonged jaundice, pale stools, and an enlarged liver are highly suggestive of **biliary atresia**. This condition causes obstruction of the bile ducts, leading to the symptoms described. The switch to formula not resolving the jaundice also supports this diagnosis, as it rules out breast milk jaundice and galactosemia to some extent.\n\n**Answer: B. Biliary atresia**", "answer": "B"}
