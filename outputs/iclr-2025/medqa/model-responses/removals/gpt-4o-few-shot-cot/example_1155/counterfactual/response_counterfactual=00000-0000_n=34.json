{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 4-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum studies show: Bilirubin Total 15 mg/dL Direct 12.3 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase 2007 U/L AST 53 U/L ALT 45 U/L \u03b3-glutamyl transferase 154 U/L Blood group A positive Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Galactosemia\nB. Biliary atresia\nC. Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome\nD. Breast milk jaundice\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:\n\n- The patient has increasing yellowing of the eyes and skin for 2 weeks, which is indicative of jaundice.\n- The stools have become pale, which suggests a lack of bile pigment.\n- The liver is palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin, indicating hepatomegaly.\n- The serum studies show elevated total bilirubin (15 mg/dL) with a predominantly direct (conjugated) bilirubin level (12.3 mg/dL).\n- Alkaline phosphatase and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase levels are significantly elevated, which are indicative of cholestasis.\n- AST and ALT levels are mildly elevated.\n\nGiven these findings, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Galactosemia**: This condition typically presents in the neonatal period with symptoms of jaundice, vomiting, poor feeding, and failure to thrive after ingestion of galactose-containing milk. However, it would usually present much earlier than 4 weeks and is associated with other metabolic abnormalities.\n\nB. **Biliary atresia**: This condition is characterized by progressive obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis. It typically presents with jaundice, pale stools, and hepatomegaly in the first few weeks of life. The laboratory findings of elevated direct bilirubin and cholestatic liver enzymes are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nC. **Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome**: This genetic disorder affects bilirubin conjugation, leading to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The bilirubin in this case is predominantly direct (conjugated), making this diagnosis unlikely.\n\nD. **Breast milk jaundice**: This condition typically presents with indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia and is not associated with pale stools or elevated alkaline phosphatase and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase levels.\n\nBased on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
