Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Galactosemia\nB. Biliary atresia\nC. Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome\nD. Breast milk jaundice\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 4-week-old female newborn with increasing jaundice, let's analyze the given information thoroughly.\n\n1. **Symptoms**:\n   - Increasing yellowing of eyes and skin for 2 weeks.\n   - Pale stools over the past week.\n   - Scleral icterus and jaundice.\n   - Liver palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin.\n\n2. **Feeding**:\n   - Initially breastfed, recently switched to formula.\n\n3. **Other clinical details**:\n   - Delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation.\n   - Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated.\n   - Healthy appearance and vital signs within normal limits.\n   - No abnormalities in cardiopulmonary and neurologic examinations.\n\n**Analysis of Options**:\n\nA. **Galactosemia**:\n   - Typically presents with symptoms soon after milk ingestion, such as vomiting, lethargy, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and failure to thrive. The baby's presentation at 4 weeks with pale stools and jaundice makes this less likely.\n\nB. **Biliary atresia**:\n   - Commonly presents with progressive jaundice after birth, pale stools (due to lack of bile), dark urine, and hepatomegaly. Given the symptoms of jaundice, pale stools, and liver enlargement, this is highly suggestive of biliary atresia.\n\nC. **Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome**:\n   - This is a rare genetic disorder causing severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It does not typically present with pale stools or hepatomegaly.\n\nD. **Breast milk jaundice**:\n   - Typically appears within the first week of life and peaks within the second to third week. It does not cause pale stools or hepatomegaly. Switching to formula would not typically result in pale stools.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe combination of progressive jaundice, pale stools, and hepatomegaly strongly indicates **Biliary atresia**.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
