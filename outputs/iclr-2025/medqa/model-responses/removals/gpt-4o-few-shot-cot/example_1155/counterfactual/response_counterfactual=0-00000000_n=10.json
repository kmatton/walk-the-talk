{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 4-week-old newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of the eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the child's stools have become pale over the past week. The newborn was breastfed since birth but the parents switched to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of the current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. The newborn appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. The newborn is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum studies show: Bilirubin Total 15 mg/dL Direct 12.3 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase 2007 U/L AST 53 U/L ALT 45 U/L \u03b3-glutamyl transferase 154 U/L Blood group A positive Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Galactosemia\nB. Biliary atresia\nC. Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome\nD. Breast milk jaundice\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 4-week-old newborn with increasing yellowing of the eyes and skin, we need to analyze the symptoms and lab results provided:\n\n1. **Jaundice and Pale Stools**: The newborn has had jaundice for 2 weeks and pale stools for the past week.\n2. **Switch to Formula Feeds**: The parents switched to formula feeds recently.\n3. **Normal Delivery and Health**: Delivered vaginally at 38 weeks with an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery.\n4. **Physical Examination**: Appears healthy, with scleral icterus, jaundice, and liver palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin.\n5. **Laboratory Results**: \n   - Total Bilirubin: 15 mg/dL\n   - Direct Bilirubin: 12.3 mg/dL\n   - Alkaline phosphatase: 2007 U/L\n   - AST: 53 U/L\n   - ALT: 45 U/L\n   - \u03b3-glutamyl transferase: 154 U/L\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each option:\n\nA. **Galactosemia**: This is a metabolic disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize galactose properly. However, it typically presents with symptoms shortly after birth and includes vomiting, poor feeding, and lethargy. The newborn's history does not fit these symptoms.\n\nB. **Biliary Atresia**: This condition involves progressive obstruction of the bile ducts, leading to jaundice, pale stools, and hepatomegaly. Lab results typically show elevated direct bilirubin and liver enzymes, which matches the presented lab results. Biliary atresia is characterized by the progressive worsening of jaundice and pale stools.\n\nC. **Crigler\u2013Najjar Syndrome**: This is a rare disorder affecting bilirubin metabolism, leading to severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The lab results show elevated direct bilirubin, making this diagnosis less likely.\n\nD. **Breast Milk Jaundice**: This typically presents with jaundice in the first week of life and is associated with indirect hyperbilirubinemia. The direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia in this case makes this diagnosis unlikely.\n\nBased on the symptoms of jaundice, pale stools, hepatomegaly, and elevated direct bilirubin and liver enzymes, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
