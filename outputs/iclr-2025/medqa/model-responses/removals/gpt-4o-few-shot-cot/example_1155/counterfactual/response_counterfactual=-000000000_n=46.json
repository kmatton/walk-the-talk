{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A female newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum studies show: Bilirubin Total 15 mg/dL Direct 12.3 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase 2007 U/L AST 53 U/L ALT 45 U/L \u03b3-glutamyl transferase 154 U/L Blood group A positive Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Galactosemia\nB. Biliary atresia\nC. Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome\nD. Breast milk jaundice\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for the female newborn with jaundice, we need to analyze the clinical presentation and laboratory findings.\n\n### Clinical Presentation:\n- **Increasing yellowing of eyes and skin for 2 weeks**\n- **Pale stools over the past week** (indicates a possible issue with bile flow)\n- **Breastfed initially, switched to formula feeds**\n- **Delivered vaginally at 38 weeks, no complications**\n- **Vital signs normal, healthy appearance**\n- **Scleral icterus and jaundice**\n- **Liver palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin**\n- **No cardiopulmonary or neurologic abnormalities**\n\n### Laboratory Findings:\n- **Total Bilirubin: 15 mg/dL**\n- **Direct Bilirubin: 12.3 mg/dL** (elevated direct bilirubin suggests cholestasis or a hepatic cause of jaundice)\n- **Alkaline Phosphatase: 2007 U/L** (significantly elevated, suggesting cholestasis or biliary obstruction)\n- **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase): 53 U/L** (slightly elevated, indicating possible liver involvement)\n- **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase): 45 U/L** (slightly elevated, indicating possible liver involvement)\n- **\u03b3-glutamyl transferase: 154 U/L** (elevated, suggesting biliary obstruction or cholestasis)\n\n### Differential Diagnosis Analysis:\n1. **Galactosemia (A)**:\n   - Typically presents in the first few days of life with feeding difficulties, vomiting, and jaundice. \n   - Usually associated with liver dysfunction, but the presentation here (pale stools) is more indicative of a biliary issue.\n\n2. **Biliary Atresia (B)**:\n   - Presents with jaundice, pale stools, and dark urine in the first few weeks of life.\n   - Direct hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase support this diagnosis.\n   - Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) is also a common finding.\n\n3. **Crigler\u2013Najjar Syndrome (C)**:\n   - Characterized by severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n   - The patient's direct bilirubin level is elevated, making this diagnosis less likely.\n\n4. **Breast Milk Jaundice (D)**:\n   - Typically presents with indirect hyperbilirubinemia.\n   - Usually appears after the first week of life and persists longer than physiological jaundice.\n   - Does not typically cause pale stools or elevated direct bilirubin levels.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the pale stools, elevated direct bilirubin, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase, the most likely diagnosis is **Biliary Atresia**.\n\n**Answer: B**", "answer": "B"}
