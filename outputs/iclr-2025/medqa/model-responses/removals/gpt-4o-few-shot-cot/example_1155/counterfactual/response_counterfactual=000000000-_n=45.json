{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 4-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Galactosemia\nB. Biliary atresia\nC. Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome\nD. Breast milk jaundice\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the patient's symptoms and findings:\n\n- Increasing yellowing of the eyes and skin for 2 weeks.\n- Pale stools over the past week.\n- The patient was breastfed but now on formula.\n- Delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation with no complications.\n- Scleral icterus and jaundice.\n- Liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin.\n- No abnormalities in cardiopulmonary or neurologic examinations.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Galactosemia**: This is a metabolic disorder that typically presents in the first few days of life with symptoms such as jaundice, vomiting, poor feeding, and lethargy. It is often associated with hepatomegaly and can lead to liver failure if untreated. However, the presentation is usually more acute and severe than what is described in this case.\n\nB. **Biliary atresia**: This condition is characterized by progressive obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, jaundice, and pale stools. It typically presents in the first few weeks to months of life and is a common cause of neonatal cholestasis. The finding of pale stools, progressive jaundice, and hepatomegaly is highly suggestive of biliary atresia.\n\nC. **Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome**: This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to a deficiency of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. It typically presents with jaundice but does not usually cause pale stools or hepatomegaly.\n\nD. **Breast milk jaundice**: This is a common cause of prolonged jaundice in breastfed infants and usually appears after the first week of life. It is not typically associated with pale stools or hepatomegaly.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of progressive jaundice, pale stools, and hepatomegaly, the most likely diagnosis is biliary atresia.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
