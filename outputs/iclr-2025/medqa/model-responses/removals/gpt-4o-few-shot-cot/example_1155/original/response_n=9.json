{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 4-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum studies show:\nBilirubin\nTotal 15 mg/dL\nDirect 12.3 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 2007 U/L\nAST 53 U/L\nALT 45 U/L\n\u03b3-glutamyl transferase 154 U/L\nBlood group A positive\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Galactosemia\nB. Biliary atresia\nC. Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome\nD. Breast milk jaundice\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 4-week-old female newborn, let's analyze the provided information step-by-step.\n\n### Key Points:\n- Increasing yellowing of eyes and skin for 2 weeks.\n- Pale stools for the past week.\n- Recent switch from breastfeeding to formula.\n- Delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation, uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery.\n- Appears healthy, vital signs within normal limits, 50th percentile for length, 60th percentile for weight.\n- On examination: scleral icterus, jaundice, liver palpable 2 cm below right costal margin.\n- Serum studies:\n  - Total bilirubin: 15 mg/dL\n  - Direct bilirubin: 12.3 mg/dL\n  - Alkaline phosphatase: 2007 U/L\n  - AST: 53 U/L\n  - ALT: 45 U/L\n  - \u03b3-glutamyl transferase: 154 U/L\n  - Blood group: A positive\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Galactosemia (A)**:\n   - Typically presents with jaundice, vomiting, poor feeding, and lethargy shortly after the introduction of milk. The patient\u2019s symptoms started at 2 weeks of age, and the current presentation is more consistent with obstructive jaundice rather than metabolic disorder.\n\n2. **Biliary atresia (B)**:\n   - Presents with jaundice starting in the first few weeks of life, pale stools, and hepatomegaly. Lab findings often show elevated direct bilirubin and liver enzymes, which matches the patient's elevated direct bilirubin (12.3 mg/dL) and elevated alkaline phosphatase (2007 U/L).\n\n3. **Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome (C)**:\n   - Characterized by severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to deficiency of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. The patient's direct bilirubin is elevated, which is not consistent with Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome.\n\n4. **Breast milk jaundice (D)**:\n   - Typically presents with jaundice in the second week of life but should not cause pale stools or such high levels of direct bilirubin. The switch to formula without improvement in jaundice also suggests another cause.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe clinical presentation of pale stools, direct hyperbilirubinemia, and hepatomegaly is most consistent with biliary atresia.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
