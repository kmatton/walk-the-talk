Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

The patient is currently unemployed and lives in a low-income neighborhood with their 3 children. For the past 3 years, their HIV RNA viral load was undetectable, but last week, their viral load was 8,391 copies/mL (N < 50). Current medications include dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine. On questioning, the patient says that they miss their medications every other day. Which of the following responses by the physician is most appropriate?\nA. \"Let's talk about what makes it difficult for you to take your medications.\"\nB. \"Are you aware that it is essential to take your medications every day?\"\nC. \"The social worker can help subsidize next month's medications.\"\nD. \"We should go over the instructions on how to take your medications again.\"\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "The patient's HIV RNA viral load has risen, indicating that their previously well-controlled HIV is no longer under control due to non-adherence to their medication regimen. The patient reports missing doses every other day, which is likely contributing to the increased viral load. \n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the patient's situation**: The patient has a history of well-controlled HIV but now has an increased viral load due to medication non-adherence. They are unemployed and live in a low-income neighborhood, which could contribute to challenges in maintaining a consistent medication routine.\n\n2. **Evaluating the options**:\n   - **Option A**: \"Let's talk about what makes it difficult for you to take your medications.\"\n     - This option demonstrates empathy and aims to understand the underlying reasons for non-adherence, which can help in finding practical solutions.\n   - **Option B**: \"Are you aware that it is essential to take your medications every day?\"\n     - This option is informative but might come off as judgmental or dismissive of the patient\u2019s challenges.\n   - **Option C**: \"The social worker can help subsidize next month's medications.\"\n     - This option addresses potential financial barriers but does not directly explore the reasons for non-adherence or offer immediate solutions.\n   - **Option D**: \"We should go over the instructions on how to take your medications again.\"\n     - This option assumes the issue is a lack of understanding, which may not be the case.\n\n3. **Choosing the best response**: The most appropriate response should aim to understand the patient's specific barriers to adherence and work collaboratively to address them.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**Option A** is the most appropriate response as it opens a dialogue to understand the patient's challenges and work towards a practical solution for medication adherence.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
