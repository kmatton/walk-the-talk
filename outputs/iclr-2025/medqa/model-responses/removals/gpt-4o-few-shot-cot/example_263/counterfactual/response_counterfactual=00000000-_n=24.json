{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

She is currently unemployed and lives in a low-income neighborhood with her 3 children. For the past 3 years, her HIV RNA viral load was undetectable, but last week, her viral load was 8,391 copies/mL (N < 50). Current medications include dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine. Which of the following responses by the physician is most appropriate?\nA. \"\"\"Let's talk about what makes it difficult for you to take your medications.\"\"\"\nB. \"\"\"Are you aware that it is essential to take your medications every day?\"\"\"\nC. \"\"\"The social worker can help subsidize next month's medications.\"\"\"\nD. \"\"\"We should go over the instructions on how to take your medications again.\"\"\"\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the correct response for the physician, let's break down the situation and analyze the options step-by-step.\n\n1. **Patient's History and Current Situation**: The patient has had a previously well-controlled HIV infection with an undetectable viral load for 3 years. Recently, her viral load increased to 8,391 copies/mL, which indicates a lapse in HIV control. She is also currently unemployed and lives in a low-income neighborhood, which may suggest potential socioeconomic barriers to consistent medication adherence.\n\n2. **Current Medications**: The patient is on a combination of dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine, which are part of standard antiretroviral therapy.\n\n3. **Possible Reasons for Increased Viral Load**: The most likely cause of the increase in viral load in a previously well-controlled patient is non-adherence to the medication regimen. Other factors could include drug resistance or drug interactions, but non-adherence is the most common and should be the first to be addressed.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **A. \"Let's talk about what makes it difficult for you to take your medications.\"**: This option opens a dialogue about potential barriers to medication adherence, which could include socioeconomic factors, side effects, forgetfulness, or misunderstanding instructions. It is empathetic and patient-centered, helping to identify and address the root cause of non-adherence.\n   - **B. \"Are you aware that it is essential to take your medications every day?\"**: While this statement is informative, it may come across as condescending or assuming that the patient lacks knowledge, rather than addressing potential barriers.\n   - **C. \"The social worker can help subsidize next month's medications.\"**: This is helpful if financial constraints are the main barrier, but it does not address other possible issues that might be impacting adherence.\n   - **D. \"We should go over the instructions on how to take your medications again.\"**: This could be useful if the issue is misunderstanding how to take the medication, but it does not address other barriers and may overlook the patient's broader context.\n\nGiven the patient's socioeconomic status and the need to understand the specific barriers to adherence, the most appropriate response would involve an open dialogue to identify and address these challenges.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
