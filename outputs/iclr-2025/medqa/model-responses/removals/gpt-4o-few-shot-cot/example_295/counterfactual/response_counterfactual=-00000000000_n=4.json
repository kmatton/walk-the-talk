{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with an acute onset rash on her torso consisting of targetoid lesions with a vesicular center. She says the rash developed 2 days ago which has progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?\nA. Lamotrigine\nB. Valproate\nC. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)\nD. Paroxetine\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's dissect this case step-by-step to determine the most likely drug causing the described symptoms.\n\n1. **Patient History and Initial Treatment**: \n   - The patient has a history of bipolar disorder.\n   - She was initially treated with lithium but showed no improvement.\n   - She was then switched to a different medication.\n\n2. **Symptoms Following New Medication**:\n   - 2 weeks after the switch, she developed an acute onset rash on her torso with targetoid lesions having a vesicular center.\n   - These are characteristic of erythema multiforme.\n   - She also experienced fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days before the rash appeared.\n\n3. **Assessment of Each Drug**:\n   - **Lamotrigine**: Known to cause severe skin reactions, including erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, especially within the first few weeks of treatment.\n   - **Valproate**: Less commonly associated with severe skin reactions, more likely to cause gastrointestinal and hepatic side effects.\n   - **Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)**: Typically does not cause severe skin reactions like erythema multiforme.\n   - **Paroxetine**: An SSRI, which can cause dermatological reactions but not typically associated with severe skin reactions like the described targetoid lesions.\n\nGiven the severe skin reaction and the timeline of symptoms after switching medications, **Lamotrigine** is the most likely culprit.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
