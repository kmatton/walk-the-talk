{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with an acute onset rash on her torso consisting of targetoid lesions with a vesicular center. She says the rash developed 2 days ago which has progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?\nA. Lamotrigine\nB. Valproate\nC. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)\nD. Paroxetine\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine which drug the patient was most likely prescribed, we need to consider the side effects associated with common medications used to treat bipolar disorder.\n\n1. **Lamotrigine**: Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant used as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder. One of its well-known side effects is the potential to cause a serious rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These conditions can present with targetoid lesions and vesicular centers, and are often preceded by flu-like symptoms such as fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills.\n\n2. **Valproate**: Valproate is another mood stabilizer used in bipolar disorder. It can cause various side effects, but severe rashes like those described are less common.\n\n3. **Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)**: This combination is used to treat bipolar depression. While it has its own set of side effects, including weight gain and metabolic issues, it is not commonly associated with severe rashes like SJS or TEN.\n\n4. **Paroxetine**: Paroxetine is an SSRI and is not typically used as a primary treatment for bipolar disorder. It can cause various side effects but is not commonly linked to severe rashes like those described.\n\nGiven the severe rash with targetoid lesions and the timing of the onset of symptoms after starting a new medication, the most likely culprit is Lamotrigine.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
