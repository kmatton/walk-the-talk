{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 27-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder presents for a 3-month follow-up after starting treatment with lithium. She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with new symptoms that developed 2 days ago and have progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?\nA. Lamotrigine\nB. Valproate\nC. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)\nD. Paroxetine\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the given information and the possible options:\n\n1. The patient had been on lithium for bipolar disorder but did not experience improvement, leading to a switch in medication.\n2. After being switched to a different medication, the patient developed new symptoms 2 weeks later.\n3. The symptoms included fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. **Lamotrigine**: Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer often used in bipolar disorder. It is known for its efficacy in treating depressive episodes. However, it is also associated with a risk of developing a serious rash (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), but this does not fit the patient's described symptoms.\n\nB. **Valproate**: Valproate (or valproic acid) is another mood stabilizer used for bipolar disorder. Common side effects include gastrointestinal disturbances, weight gain, and tremor. It is less likely to cause fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills.\n\nC. **Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)**: This combination is used to treat depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. While it can cause various side effects, the described symptoms do not match the common side effects of this medication.\n\nD. **Paroxetine**: Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. One potential side effect of SSRIs is the development of serotonin syndrome, which can present with symptoms like fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills, particularly if the patient was previously on a medication like lithium or if there is a drug interaction.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms (fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills), the most likely cause is serotonin syndrome, which is associated with the initiation of an SSRI like paroxetine.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": "D"}
