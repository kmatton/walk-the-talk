{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 27-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder presents for a 3-month follow-up after starting treatment with lithium. She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with new symptoms that developed 2 days ago and have progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?\nA. Lamotrigine\nB. Valproate\nC. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)\nD. Paroxetine\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the likely drug prescribed, we need to consider the symptoms presented after switching medications from lithium, which is used in bipolar disorder treatment.\n\n1. **Lamotrigine**: This drug is used as a mood stabilizer and anticonvulsant and is often prescribed for bipolar disorder. However, one of its significant side effects is a rash which can progress to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a severe skin reaction. The progression of symptoms described (fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills) followed by worsening symptoms could be indicative of a severe adverse skin reaction.\n\n2. **Valproate**: This is another mood stabilizer used in bipolar disorder. While it has its own set of side effects, the symptoms described do not particularly align with common adverse reactions to valproate.\n\n3. **Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)**: This combination is used for treating bipolar depression. The symptoms described do not strongly correlate with known side effects of this combination.\n\n4. **Paroxetine**: This is an SSRI used for depression and anxiety disorders. It could potentially cause some of the symptoms described (like lethargy and myalgia), but it's less likely to be used immediately after lithium without a more direct indication for depression or anxiety rather than mood stabilization in bipolar disorder.\n\nGiven the described symptoms and their alignment with known adverse effects, the most likely prescribed drug is **Lamotrigine**.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
