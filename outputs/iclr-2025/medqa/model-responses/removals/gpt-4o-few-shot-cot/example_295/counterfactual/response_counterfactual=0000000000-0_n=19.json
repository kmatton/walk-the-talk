Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with new symptoms that developed 2 days ago and have progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?\nA. Lamotrigine\nB. Valproate\nC. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)\nD. Paroxetine\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine which drug the patient was most likely prescribed, we need to consider her history and symptoms following the switch from lithium, as well as the typical side effects of the alternative medications listed.\n\n1. **Lamotrigine**: It is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer used in bipolar disorder. A notable side effect is the risk of developing a serious rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which can present with fever and malaise before the rash appears.\n\n2. **Valproate**: Another mood stabilizer used in bipolar disorder, which can cause side effects such as weight gain, tremor, and gastrointestinal disturbances. However, it is less likely to cause the acute symptoms described.\n\n3. **Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)**: This combination is used for treatment-resistant depression in bipolar disorder. Side effects include metabolic disturbances, weight gain, and sedation, but it is not strongly associated with the acute symptoms described.\n\n4. **Paroxetine**: An SSRI used for depression and anxiety, which can cause initial side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbance and insomnia, but it is not typically associated with the fever, lethargy, and myalgia described.\n\nGiven the description of the patient's symptoms (fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved, followed by progressive worsening of symptoms), Lamotrigine is the most likely candidate due to the risk of serious rash and systemic symptoms.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
