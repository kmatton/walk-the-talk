{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with an acute onset rash on her torso consisting of targetoid lesions with a vesicular center. She says the rash developed 2 days ago which has progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?\nA. Lamotrigine\nB. Valproate\nC. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)\nD. Paroxetine\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question step-by-step, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Patient Background and Initial Treatment**:\n   - The patient was initially treated with lithium for a psychiatric condition, likely bipolar disorder, given the context.\n   - The patient reported no improvement after 3 months of lithium treatment, prompting a medication change.\n\n2. **New Symptoms Post Medication Switch**:\n   - The patient presents 2 weeks later with a rash on her torso, described as targetoid lesions with a vesicular center.\n   - She also experienced fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days.\n\n3. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - The description of the rash (targetoid lesions with a vesicular center) is suggestive of erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).\n   - SJS is a serious condition often associated with certain medications, including antiepileptics and antibiotics.\n\n4. **Medication Analysis**:\n   - **A. Lamotrigine**: Known to have a significant risk of causing Stevens-Johnson syndrome, especially when first introduced or when the dose is rapidly increased.\n   - **B. Valproate**: Generally not associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome as frequently as lamotrigine.\n   - **C. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)**: Less likely to cause SJS compared to lamotrigine.\n   - **D. Paroxetine**: An SSRI, not typically linked to Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and the known side effect profile of these medications, the most likely drug that caused the patient's symptoms is lamotrigine.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
