Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with an acute onset rash on her torso consisting of targetoid lesions with a vesicular center. She says the rash developed 2 days ago which has progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?\nA. Lamotrigine\nB. Valproate\nC. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)\nD. Paroxetine\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To identify the medication most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms, let's analyze the clinical presentation and side effect profiles of each option.\n\n### Clinical Presentation\n- **Targetoid lesions with a vesicular center**: This description is consistent with erythema multiforme, a hypersensitivity reaction that can be triggered by medications.\n- **Fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills**: These systemic symptoms preceding the rash suggest an inflammatory or hypersensitivity process.\n\n### Medication Side Effect Profiles\n- **Lamotrigine**: Known for potentially causing serious skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and erythema multiforme, especially when first initiated or when dose is rapidly increased.\n- **Valproate**: Can cause a variety of side effects but serious rashes like erythema multiforme or SJS are less common.\n- **Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)**: Common side effects include weight gain and metabolic syndrome, but serious rashes are less typical.\n- **Paroxetine**: An SSRI with side effects primarily related to serotonin modulation, and serious skin reactions are not commonly associated.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the description of the rash and the systemic symptoms, the medication most likely responsible for the patient's presentation is **Lamotrigine** due to its well-known association with serious dermatological reactions such as erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
