Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with new symptoms that developed 2 days ago and have progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?\nA. Lamotrigine\nB. Valproate\nC. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)\nD. Paroxetine\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and the potential side effects of the medications listed.\n\n1. **Lithium** is a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder, particularly effective for managing manic episodes. Since the patient has not responded to lithium and has no other significant past medical history or medications, switching to another mood stabilizer or antipsychotic is a reasonable step.\n\n2. The patient's new symptoms include fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days, followed by the development of worsening symptoms over the next 2 days. These symptoms suggest a potential adverse drug reaction.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Lamotrigine**:\n   - Side effects include rash, which can be severe (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) but fever, myalgia, and chills are not typical.\n\nB. **Valproate**:\n   - Valproate can cause side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances, tremor, and weight gain. It is not typically associated with fever, myalgia, or chills resolving and then worsening.\n\nC. **Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)**:\n   - This combination is used for bipolar depression. Olanzapine can cause metabolic side effects, weight gain, and sedation. Fluoxetine, an SSRI, can cause gastrointestinal disturbances and activation. These symptoms are not consistent with the patient's presentation.\n\nD. **Paroxetine**:\n   - Paroxetine is an SSRI that can cause side effects like nausea, dizziness, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. It can also cause serotonin syndrome, which includes fever, myoclonus, autonomic instability, and mental status changes. The symptoms described (fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills) could be consistent with serotonin syndrome.\n\nGiven the patient's abrupt onset of symptoms and their resolution followed by worsening, **serotonin syndrome** is the most likely diagnosis, indicating that **Paroxetine** was the medication prescribed.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": "D"}
