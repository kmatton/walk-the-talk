{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having unknown symptoms. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?\nA. Affective symptoms\nB. Being single\nC. Male sex\nD. Negative symptoms\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most accurate answer, let's analyze the information provided and refer to authoritative sources as needed.\n\nThe patient's recent behavior change, including increased sociability, grandiosity, and agitation when his ideas are not accepted, suggests symptoms consistent with a manic episode. This could be indicative of Bipolar Disorder.\n\nWhen considering predictors of good prognosis for psychiatric conditions, especially Bipolar Disorder, the following factors are generally noted:\n\n1. **Affective symptoms**: These typically include mood disturbances such as depression or mania. The presence of affective symptoms, especially if they are episodic and the patient returns to baseline between episodes, is often associated with a better prognosis compared to chronic, persistent symptoms.\n\n2. **Being single**: Lack of social support and isolation can often be associated with a poorer prognosis.\n\n3. **Male sex**: The prognosis can vary and is not necessarily better or worse based solely on sex.\n\n4. **Negative symptoms**: These include symptoms such as blunted affect, social withdrawal, and lack of motivation. Negative symptoms are generally associated with a poorer prognosis, particularly in schizophrenia.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- **Affective symptoms (A)**, such as the manic episode described, can be treated and managed effectively with medication and therapy, leading to better outcomes.\n- Being single (B) does not provide social support, which can be crucial for recovery.\n- Male sex (C) is not a significant predictor on its own.\n- Negative symptoms (D) are associated with a poorer prognosis.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
