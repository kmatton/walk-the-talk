The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?\nA. Affective symptoms\nB. Being single\nC. Male sex\nD. Negative symptoms\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the best answer, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and identify which factor is generally associated with a better prognosis in psychiatric conditions, especially those that might involve psychotic features given the hallucinations and drastic behavior changes described.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **A. Affective symptoms**: Affective symptoms, such as mood disturbances (e.g., depression or mania), generally indicate a mood disorder or schizoaffective disorder rather than pure schizophrenia. These conditions often have a better prognosis because they can be more responsive to treatment.\n  \n- **B. Being single**: Being single is not typically associated with a better prognosis in psychiatric disorders. Social support is often a positive factor in recovery.\n  \n- **C. Male sex**: Male sex is associated with a worse prognosis in many psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, due to earlier onset and more severe course.\n  \n- **D. Negative symptoms**: Negative symptoms (e.g., flat affect, social withdrawal) are associated with a worse prognosis because they are more resistant to treatment and impair social and occupational functioning.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the patient's presentation, the presence of affective symptoms (such as the sudden change in mood and increased activity) is generally a predictor of a better prognosis, as these symptoms can often be treated more effectively and may indicate a mood disorder component.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
