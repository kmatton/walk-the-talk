Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

The patient has a flat affect and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?\nA. Affective symptoms\nB. Being single\nC. Male sex\nD. Negative symptoms\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the predictor of good prognosis for the patient's condition, we need to analyze the clinical presentation and the implications of different symptoms.\n\nThe patient's history reveals a sudden change in behavior, auditory hallucinations, and increased social activity with grandiose ideas. This presentation is suggestive of a psychiatric condition that may involve mood disturbances, potentially bipolar disorder with psychotic features or schizophrenia. Given the presence of affective symptoms (such as sudden interest in social activities and grandiosity), let's review the options:\n\nA. **Affective symptoms** - These symptoms can indicate a mood disorder such as bipolar disorder, which generally has a better prognosis compared to disorders with predominantly negative symptoms like schizophrenia.\n\nB. **Being single** - Social isolation or being single is generally associated with poorer outcomes in psychiatric conditions.\n\nC. **Male sex** - Male sex is not specifically associated with a better prognosis in psychiatric conditions and can often be associated with a poorer outcome in some cases.\n\nD. **Negative symptoms** - These include flat affect, social withdrawal, and lack of motivation, which are associated with poorer prognosis.\n\nThus, the presence of affective symptoms often indicates a better prognosis compared to negative symptoms, as mood disorders tend to respond better to treatment than primary negative symptoms.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
