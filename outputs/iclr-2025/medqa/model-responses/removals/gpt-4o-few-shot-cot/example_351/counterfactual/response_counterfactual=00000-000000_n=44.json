He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?\nA. Affective symptoms\nB. Being single\nC. Male sex\nD. Negative symptoms\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the case step-by-step.\n\nThe patient exhibits symptoms that suggest a psychiatric condition, characterized by a sudden change in behavior, increased sociability, and grandiosity. These symptoms, combined with auditory hallucinations and a flat affect, may suggest a diagnosis along the lines of a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\nA. **Affective symptoms**: These include symptoms related to mood, such as depression or mania. In the context of psychotic disorders, the presence of affective symptoms is generally considered to be a positive prognostic indicator because it suggests a possible mood disorder component, which can often be treated more effectively than primary psychotic disorders.\n\nB. **Being single**: Lack of social support and close personal relationships is typically associated with a poorer prognosis in psychiatric conditions.\n\nC. **Male sex**: Generally, male sex is not considered a predictor of good prognosis in psychotic disorders. In fact, males often have an earlier onset and potentially more severe course of illness.\n\nD. **Negative symptoms**: These include affective flattening, alogia, and anhedonia. Negative symptoms are typically associated with a poorer prognosis because they are more difficult to treat and tend to persist longer.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAmong the options provided, the presence of affective symptoms (such as mood disturbances) is generally considered a positive prognostic indicator in psychotic disorders.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
