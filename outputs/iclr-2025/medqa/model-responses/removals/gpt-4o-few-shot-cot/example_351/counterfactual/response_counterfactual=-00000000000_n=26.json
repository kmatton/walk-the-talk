{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A man is brought to the emergency department by a concerned neighbor. The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?\nA. Affective symptoms\nB. Being single\nC. Male sex\nD. Negative symptoms\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the predictor of good prognosis in this patient's condition, we need to analyze the symptoms and context provided. The patient exhibits signs of a potential psychiatric disorder characterized by auditory hallucinations, a flat affect, and sudden changes in behavior suggestive of a manic episode. Common conditions with such presentations include schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Affective Symptoms:** These typically include mood-related symptoms such as depression or mania. In psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder, affective symptoms can sometimes indicate a better prognosis compared to conditions dominated by negative symptoms (e.g., flat affect, social withdrawal).\n\n2. **Being Single:** Social isolation and lack of support systems can often be associated with poorer prognoses in psychiatric conditions.\n\n3. **Male Sex:** Gender itself is not a strong predictor of prognosis in psychiatric conditions. However, some studies suggest that females may have a slightly better prognosis in certain psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.\n\n4. **Negative Symptoms:** In conditions like schizophrenia, negative symptoms (e.g., flat affect, lack of motivation) are generally associated with a poorer prognosis compared to positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions).\n\nGiven this context, affective symptoms (such as the sudden increased sociability and talkativeness in this patient) are generally considered to be associated with a better prognosis compared to negative symptoms. This is because affective symptoms are often more responsive to treatment and may indicate a more episodic course rather than a chronic deterioration.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
