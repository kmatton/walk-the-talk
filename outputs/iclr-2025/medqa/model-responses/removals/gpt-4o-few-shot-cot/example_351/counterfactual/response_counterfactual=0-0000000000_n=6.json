{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?\nA. Affective symptoms\nB. Being single\nC. Male sex\nD. Negative symptoms\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the predictor of a good prognosis for this patient's condition, we need to consider the presented symptoms and the known prognostic factors for psychiatric conditions.\n\n1. **Affective symptoms**: These symptoms include mood disturbances such as depression or mania. The presence of affective symptoms in schizophrenia is generally considered a positive prognostic factor because it suggests a more episodic course of the illness and a better response to treatment.\n\n2. **Being single**: Lack of a support system is generally associated with a poorer prognosis in psychiatric conditions. Being single, therefore, does not predict a good prognosis.\n\n3. **Male sex**: Male sex is often associated with a poorer prognosis in schizophrenia due to earlier onset and more severe course of the disease.\n\n4. **Negative symptoms**: These include blunted affect, alogia (poverty of speech), and avolition (lack of motivation). Negative symptoms are associated with a poorer prognosis as they are more difficult to treat and often persist longer.\n\nGiven these considerations, the presence of affective symptoms (suggested by the patient's recent changes in behavior, mood fluctuations, and increased social engagement) is generally associated with a better prognosis.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
