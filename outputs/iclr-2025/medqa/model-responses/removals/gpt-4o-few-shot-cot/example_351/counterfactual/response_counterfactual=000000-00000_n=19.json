Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?\nA. Affective symptoms\nB. Being single\nC. Male sex\nD. Negative symptoms\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To address this question, we need to identify the likely diagnosis and then understand the factors that predict a good prognosis for this condition.\n\nThe patient exhibits symptoms that are indicative of a psychotic disorder, likely schizophrenia, given the auditory hallucinations and negative symptoms (flat affect, disheveled appearance). Additionally, the sudden change in behavior, increased talkativeness, and grandiosity are suggestive of a manic episode, which may be part of a bipolar disorder with psychotic features.\n\nIn terms of prognosis for schizophrenia and similar psychiatric conditions, the following factors are generally considered:\n\n- **Affective symptoms** (e.g., mood disturbances) tend to be associated with a better prognosis because they are often more responsive to treatment.\n- **Being single** is not generally associated with a better prognosis.\n- **Male sex** is not specifically linked to a better prognosis and may actually be associated with a worse prognosis in some studies.\n- **Negative symptoms** (e.g., flat affect, social withdrawal) are generally associated with a poorer prognosis as they are harder to treat and have a greater impact on functioning.\n\nConsidering these points, the presence of affective symptoms (such as mood disturbances seen in mania or depression) is typically a predictor of a better prognosis in psychiatric disorders.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
