{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A female presents to her primary physician for follow up after an ED visit for nephrolithiasis 1 week prior. CT scan in the ED revealed a 4-mm stone occluding the right ureter. She was able to pass the stone without assistance over the course of 5 hours. Pathology report on the stone states it was composed of calcium oxalate. She says that the pain of passing the stone was excruciating and asks how she can prevent kidney stones in the future. Which of the following interventions is most likely to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient?\nA. Decreasing calcium intake\nB. Decreasing sodium intake\nC. Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds\nD. Urine acidification with cranberry juice\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the best intervention to prevent renal calculi formation in this patient with a history of calcium oxalate stones, we need to evaluate the options based on medical knowledge regarding kidney stone prevention.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n\nA. **Decreasing calcium intake**: Although it might seem intuitive to reduce calcium intake to prevent calcium stones, doing so can actually increase the risk of stone formation. This is because dietary calcium binds to oxalate in the gut, reducing oxalate absorption and subsequent urinary excretion. Lower calcium intake can lead to higher oxalate levels in the urine, promoting stone formation.\n\nB. **Decreasing sodium intake**: High sodium intake can increase calcium excretion in the urine, which can contribute to calcium stone formation. Reducing dietary sodium can help lower urinary calcium levels and decrease the risk of stone formation.\n\nC. **Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds**: Nuts and seeds are high in oxalates, which can contribute to the formation of calcium oxalate stones. Therefore, increasing their consumption is not advisable for someone prone to these types of stones.\n\nD. **Urine acidification with cranberry juice**: Cranberry juice can acidify the urine, but this is not typically recommended for calcium oxalate stones. Urine acidification is more relevant for preventing certain types of stones, like uric acid stones, but not calcium oxalate stones.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most evidence-based intervention to prevent the formation of calcium oxalate stones is decreasing sodium intake, as this can help reduce urinary calcium excretion.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
