{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A stillborn infant is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a woman. The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the stillborn shows a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. An x-ray shows the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Maternal oligohydramnios\nB. Intrauterine alcohol exposure\nC. Maternal diabetes\nD. Chromosome 18 trisomy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this step-by-step, let's consider each option and the associated conditions:\n\n1. **Maternal oligohydramnios**: This condition is characterized by low amniotic fluid levels and is associated with Potter sequence (renal agenesis leading to limb deformities, facial anomalies, and pulmonary hypoplasia). The described symptoms (small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet) do not directly align with Potter sequence.\n\n2. **Intrauterine alcohol exposure**: This can result in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), characterized by facial abnormalities (smooth philtrum, thin upper lip), growth retardation, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The skeletal abnormalities described are not typical features of FAS.\n\n3. **Maternal diabetes**: This is strongly associated with caudal regression syndrome, which involves anomalies of the lower vertebrae, pelvis, and lower limbs. This syndrome fits the symptoms described in the stillborn infant: small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet along with the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae.\n\n4. **Chromosome 18 trisomy**: Also known as Edwards syndrome, this condition is associated with features such as clenched hands with overlapping fingers, rocker-bottom feet, micrognathia, and congenital heart defects. While some limb abnormalities are present, the specific combination of spinal and pelvic anomalies described in the question is more indicative of caudal regression syndrome.\n\nGiven the described abnormalities and their strong association with maternal diabetes, the most likely diagnosis is caudal regression syndrome.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
