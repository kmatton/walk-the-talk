{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A stillborn infant is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman. The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the stillborn shows a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Maternal oligohydramnios\nB. Intrauterine alcohol exposure\nC. Maternal diabetes\nD. Chromosome 18 trisomy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the case systematically to identify the most likely predisposing factor for the stillborn infant's condition.\n\n- **Small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet**: These features can be associated with multiple conditions, but we need to find the underlying factor that connects them all.\n- **Maternal oligohydramnios**: This condition is characterized by reduced amniotic fluid, which can lead to compression of the fetus and result in physical deformities such as club feet and underdeveloped lungs.\n- **Intrauterine alcohol exposure**: This can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, which typically presents with facial abnormalities, growth deficiencies, and neurodevelopmental issues, but not specifically with the features described.\n- **Maternal diabetes**: This can lead to large-for-gestational-age infants, congenital heart defects, and other malformations, but the described features do not strongly correlate with maternal diabetes.\n- **Chromosome 18 trisomy (Edwards syndrome)**: This chromosomal anomaly can result in multiple congenital deformities, including rocker-bottom feet (a form of club feet), but it typically also presents with other prominent features such as clenched fists with overlapping fingers, micrognathia, and severe intellectual disability.\n\nGiven the specific features of the stillborn infant (small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet), **maternal oligohydramnios** is the most likely predisposing factor, as it can lead to physical deformities due to the restricted space and compression in utero.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
