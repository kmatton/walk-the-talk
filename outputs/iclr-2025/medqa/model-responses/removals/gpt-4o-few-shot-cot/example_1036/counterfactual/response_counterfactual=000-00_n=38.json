{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 38-week gestation infant is delivered to a 32-year-old woman. The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the infant shows a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. An x-ray shows the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Maternal oligohydramnios\nB. Intrauterine alcohol exposure\nC. Maternal diabetes\nD. Chromosome 18 trisomy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this step-by-step, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and correlate them with known conditions and their predisposing factors.\n\n1. **Maternal oligohydramnios**: This condition is characterized by low amniotic fluid levels and is often associated with conditions such as Potter sequence, which leads to pulmonary hypoplasia, limb deformities, and Potter facies. The patient's symptoms are more specific to spinal and limb abnormalities rather than those caused by oligohydramnios.\n\n2. **Intrauterine alcohol exposure**: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) due to intrauterine alcohol exposure can cause a variety of congenital abnormalities, including facial dysmorphisms, growth retardation, and central nervous system abnormalities. However, the specific abnormalities seen in this patient (absence of sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet) are not typical of FAS.\n\n3. **Maternal diabetes**: Maternal diabetes is a well-known risk factor for caudal regression syndrome (CRS), which is characterized by the underdevelopment of the lower spine and lower extremities. The symptoms described (absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet) are consistent with caudal regression syndrome.\n\n4. **Chromosome 18 trisomy**: Also known as Edwards syndrome, this genetic disorder is characterized by a range of severe congenital abnormalities, including clenched fists, rocker-bottom feet, micrognathia, and various organ malformations. However, the specific spinal and limb abnormalities described in this patient are more indicative of caudal regression syndrome rather than Edwards syndrome.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation, the strongest predisposing factor is consistent with maternal diabetes.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
