{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A stillborn infant is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman. The mother had no prenatal care. An x-ray shows the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Maternal oligohydramnios\nB. Intrauterine alcohol exposure\nC. Maternal diabetes\nD. Chromosome 18 trisomy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "The key to solving this question is understanding the likely cause of sacral and lumbar vertebral agenesis, which can be linked to maternal conditions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Consider each option in relation to sacral and lumbar vertebral agenesis**:\n\n   - **A. Maternal oligohydramnios**: This condition is associated with Potter sequence, which includes pulmonary hypoplasia, limb deformities, and characteristic facial anomalies. It is not typically associated with sacral and lumbar vertebral agenesis.\n   \n   - **B. Intrauterine alcohol exposure**: While fetal alcohol syndrome can cause a variety of congenital anomalies, sacral and lumbar vertebral agenesis is not commonly among them.\n   \n   - **C. Maternal diabetes**: Diabetic embryopathy is a known risk factor for caudal regression syndrome, which includes sacral and lumbar vertebral agenesis. This condition is strongly associated with poorly controlled maternal diabetes.\n   \n   - **D. Chromosome 18 trisomy**: This chromosomal abnormality, also known as Edwards syndrome, is associated with a variety of congenital defects, but sacral and lumbar vertebral agenesis is not a prominent feature.\n\n2. **Strongest predisposing factor**:\n   - The strongest association with sacral and lumbar vertebral agenesis is with maternal diabetes (option C).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the strong association between maternal diabetes and the congenital absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**", "answer": "C"}
