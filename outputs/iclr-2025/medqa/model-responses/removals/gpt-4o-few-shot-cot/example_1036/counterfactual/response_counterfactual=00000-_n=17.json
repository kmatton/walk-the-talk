{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A stillborn infant is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman. The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the stillborn shows a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Maternal oligohydramnios\nB. Intrauterine alcohol exposure\nC. Maternal diabetes\nD. Chromosome 18 trisomy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the given clinical scenario and the options step-by-step:\n\n1. **Stillborn infant at 38 weeks' gestation**: This indicates a full-term pregnancy that unfortunately ended in fetal demise.\n\n2. **No prenatal care**: Lack of prenatal care can lead to undiagnosed and untreated conditions that could affect fetal development.\n\n3. **Examination findings**:\n   - **Small pelvis**\n   - **Shallow intergluteal cleft**\n   - **Club feet**\n\nThese physical examination findings suggest a possible underlying condition that could have predisposed to these abnormalities.\n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n\n**A. Maternal oligohydramnios**:\n- Oligohydramnios refers to a deficiency of amniotic fluid.\n- It is known to cause fetal compression, leading to physical deformities such as club feet and facial abnormalities.\n- It also can result in pulmonary hypoplasia and other developmental issues.\n\n**B. Intrauterine alcohol exposure**:\n- Alcohol exposure in utero can lead to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by facial abnormalities, growth deficiencies, and central nervous system dysfunction.\n- However, FAS does not typically cause the specific combination of physical findings seen here (small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet).\n\n**C. Maternal diabetes**:\n- Maternal diabetes can lead to macrosomia (large body size) and other complications, but it does not typically cause the specific physical abnormalities noted in this case.\n\n**D. Chromosome 18 trisomy**:\n- Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) is a genetic disorder characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities, including clenched hands, rocker-bottom feet, and structural heart defects.\n- However, the specific combination of findings (small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet) is more suggestive of mechanical deformation rather than a chromosomal anomaly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe combination of a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet is most consistent with the physical deformities seen in cases of prolonged oligohydramnios. The deficiency of amniotic fluid leads to mechanical compression and subsequent developmental anomalies.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
