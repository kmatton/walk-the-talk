{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A stillborn infant is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman. The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the stillborn shows a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Maternal oligohydramnios\nB. Intrauterine alcohol exposure\nC. Maternal diabetes\nD. Chromosome 18 trisomy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and physical findings provided in the context of the stillborn infant. The key features mentioned are a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. Let\u2019s review each option:\n\nA. **Maternal oligohydramnios**: This condition is characterized by a deficiency in amniotic fluid, which can lead to various fetal deformations due to the lack of cushioning and space for the fetus to develop properly. Common issues include limb deformities (e.g., club feet), facial deformities, and pulmonary hypoplasia. The small pelvis and shallow intergluteal cleft could also be associated with restricted growth due to oligohydramnios.\n\nB. **Intrauterine alcohol exposure**: Fetal alcohol syndrome can cause growth retardation, facial abnormalities, and central nervous system dysfunction, but it does not typically present with the specific features described (small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet).\n\nC. **Maternal diabetes**: This condition can lead to various complications in the fetus, including macrosomia (large body size), congenital anomalies (e.g., neural tube defects), and even stillbirth. However, the characteristic features listed are not typically associated with maternal diabetes.\n\nD. **Chromosome 18 trisomy**: Also known as Edwards syndrome, this genetic disorder can lead to severe developmental delays, congenital heart defects, and characteristic physical abnormalities such as a small jaw, clenched fists, and rocker-bottom feet. While it can cause a wide range of symptoms, the specific features of small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet are not classic hallmarks.\n\nGiven the information and considering the typical presentations, the most likely cause of the infant's condition is related to maternal oligohydramnios, which can restrict fetal movement and development, leading to physical deformities such as club feet and other skeletal abnormalities.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
