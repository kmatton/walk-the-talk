{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A stillborn infant is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman. The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the stillborn shows a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Maternal oligohydramnios\nB. Intrauterine alcohol exposure\nC. Maternal diabetes\nD. Chromosome 18 trisomy\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the strongest predisposing factor for the stillborn infant's condition, let's analyze the clinical features and consider the possible causes.\n\n- **Small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet**: These findings can be indicative of congenital abnormalities or syndromes. The combination of these features suggests a structural or developmental abnormality.\n\n1. **Maternal oligohydramnios**:\n   - Oligohydramnios refers to a deficiency of amniotic fluid.\n   - It can lead to Potter sequence, which includes features such as renal agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, and limb deformities like club feet due to restricted movement in utero.\n   - The small pelvis and shallow intergluteal cleft could be secondary to restricted development due to oligohydramnios.\n\n2. **Intrauterine alcohol exposure**:\n   - This can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, which is characterized by facial abnormalities, growth retardation, and central nervous system dysfunction.\n   - The described features (small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet) are not typical findings of fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\n3. **Maternal diabetes**:\n   - Uncontrolled maternal diabetes can result in a range of fetal anomalies, including neural tube defects and caudal regression syndrome.\n   - However, the combination of the features described does not strongly suggest diabetic embryopathy.\n\n4. **Chromosome 18 trisomy (Edwards syndrome)**:\n   - This condition is associated with multiple congenital anomalies, including clenched hands, overlapping fingers, rocker-bottom feet, and other structural abnormalities.\n   - While it can present with a variety of malformations, the specific combination of findings here does not strongly point to Edwards syndrome.\n\nGiven the set of symptoms (small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet) and the need to identify the strongest predisposing factor, maternal oligohydramnios is the most consistent with these findings due to its association with Potter sequence and related developmental constraints.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
