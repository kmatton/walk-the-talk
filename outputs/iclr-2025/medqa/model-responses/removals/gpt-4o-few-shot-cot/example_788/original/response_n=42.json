Laboratory studies show:\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 15 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.0 mg/dL\nUrine\nBlood 1+\nProtein 1+\nRBC 15\u201317/hpf\nWBC 1\u20132/hpf\nThe audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?\nA. Alport syndrome\nB. Fabry\u2019s disease\nC. Von Hippel-Lindau disease\nD. Tuberous sclerosis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the given information to solve this step-by-step:\n\n- The 14-year-old boy has increasing difficulty in hearing, requiring people to speak louder for him to understand.\n- He also has trouble reading because he cannot see the words clearly.\n- His father had a renal transplant in his 20s, suggesting a possible hereditary condition affecting the kidneys.\n- Laboratory studies show mild proteinuria (1+), hematuria (15\u201317 RBCs/hpf), and normal kidney function (BUN and creatinine levels within normal limits).\n- Audiometry indicates bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.\n- Ophthalmologic examination reveals anterior lenticonus.\n\nThese findings together point towards a specific syndrome:\n\n- Alport syndrome is characterized by a combination of sensorineural hearing loss, eye abnormalities (including anterior lenticonus), and kidney disease, which aligns with the patient's clinical presentation and family history.\n\nFabry's disease, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, and Tuberous sclerosis do not fit all the clinical features presented in this case.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
