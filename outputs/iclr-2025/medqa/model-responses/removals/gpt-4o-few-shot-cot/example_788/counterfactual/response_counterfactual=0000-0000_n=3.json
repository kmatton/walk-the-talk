{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an increasing difficulty in hearing over the past several months. His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show: Serum Urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL Urine Blood 1+ Protein 1+ RBC 15\u201317/hpf WBC 1\u20132/hpf The audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?\nA. Alport syndrome\nB. Fabry\u2019s disease\nC. Von Hippel-Lindau disease\nD. Tuberous sclerosis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most appropriate diagnosis for the 14-year-old boy with hearing and vision difficulties, let's analyze the symptoms and laboratory findings:\n\n1. **Hearing Issues**: The boy has bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.\n2. **Vision Issues**: He is having difficulty reading due to unclear vision, and ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus.\n3. **Family History**: His father received a renal transplant in his 20s, suggesting a possible hereditary renal condition.\n4. **Laboratory Findings**: \n   - Serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are within normal ranges.\n   - Urinalysis shows 1+ blood, 1+ protein, and 15-17 RBCs/hpf, indicating hematuria and proteinuria.\n\nGiven these findings, let's review the options:\n\nA. **Alport syndrome**: This is a genetic disorder characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. Anterior lenticonus (conical deformation of the lens) is a classic finding in Alport syndrome. The patient's symptoms and family history align well with this syndrome.\n\nB. **Fabry\u2019s disease**: This is a lysosomal storage disorder that can cause kidney disease, but it typically presents with pain crises, angiokeratomas, and corneal opacities rather than anterior lenticonus and sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nC. **Von Hippel-Lindau disease**: This genetic disorder is associated with hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytomas. It does not typically cause anterior lenticonus, hearing loss, or the renal symptoms described.\n\nD. **Tuberous sclerosis**: This condition involves benign tumors in multiple organs and can cause seizures, developmental delay, and skin abnormalities. It does not typically present with anterior lenticonus or the described renal and hearing issues.\n\nAfter considering all the symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
