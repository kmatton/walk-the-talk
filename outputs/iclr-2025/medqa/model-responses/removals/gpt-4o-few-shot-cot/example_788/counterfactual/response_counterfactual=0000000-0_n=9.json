{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions.

His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show: Serum Urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL Urine Blood 1+ Protein 1+ RBC 15\u201317/hpf WBC 1\u20132/hpf The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?\nA. Alport syndrome\nB. Fabry\u2019s disease\nC. Von Hippel-Lindau disease\nD. Tuberous sclerosis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the correct diagnosis for the 14-year-old boy, we need to analyze the provided information and match it with typical characteristics of the listed conditions. \n\n1. **Alport syndrome**:\n   - X-linked dominant disorder affecting collagen synthesis.\n   - Characterized by progressive nephritis, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities such as anterior lenticonus.\n   - Given the patient's family history of renal transplant, proteinuria, hematuria, sensorineural hearing loss, and anterior lenticonus, this fits well with Alport syndrome.\n\n2. **Fabry\u2019s disease**:\n   - X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A.\n   - Symptoms include acroparesthesias, angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, corneal opacity, renal failure, and cardiovascular issues.\n   - The patient's primary symptoms (hearing loss, visual problems, and renal issues) do not align as well with Fabry\u2019s disease.\n\n3. **Von Hippel-Lindau disease**:\n   - Autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple tumors, both benign and malignant.\n   - Common manifestations include hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytomas, and retinal angiomas.\n   - The described symptoms do not align with Von Hippel-Lindau disease.\n\n4. **Tuberous sclerosis**:\n   - Genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous noncancerous (benign) tumors in many parts of the body.\n   - Manifestations include skin abnormalities, seizures, cognitive impairment, and renal angiomyolipomas.\n   - The provided symptoms do not align with Tuberous sclerosis.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the family history of renal issues, Alport syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
