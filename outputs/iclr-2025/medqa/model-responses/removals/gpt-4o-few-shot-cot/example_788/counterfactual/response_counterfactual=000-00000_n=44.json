{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an increasing difficulty in hearing over the past several months. His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show: Serum Urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL Urine Blood 1+ Protein 1+ RBC 15\u201317/hpf WBC 1\u20132/hpf The audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?\nA. Alport syndrome\nB. Fabry\u2019s disease\nC. Von Hippel-Lindau disease\nD. Tuberous sclerosis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, we need to look at the patient's symptoms and their correlation with specific syndromes.\n\n1. **Hearing Loss**: The boy has bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. This type of hearing loss is common in genetic syndromes that affect the kidneys.\n\n2. **Vision Problems**: He has difficulty reading because he cannot see the words clearly. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus, which is a bulging of the lens capsule into the anterior chamber of the eye.\n\n3. **Urine Findings**: Laboratory studies show blood and protein in the urine along with elevated RBCs. This indicates hematuria and proteinuria, which are often seen in kidney disorders.\n\n4. **Kidney Function**: Serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are within normal limits, suggesting that while there is some kidney involvement, the function is still preserved.\n\nConsidering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Alport syndrome**, which is a genetic condition characterized by progressive kidney disease, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities such as anterior lenticonus.\n\n- **Alport syndrome (A)**: This syndrome fits all the symptoms described: sensorineural hearing loss, hematuria, proteinuria, and anterior lenticonus.\n- **Fabry\u2019s disease (B)**: This condition can cause kidney issues and hearing loss but typically includes pain, angiokeratomas, and corneal opacities, which were not mentioned.\n- **Von Hippel-Lindau disease (C)**: This disease involves tumors and cysts in multiple organs but does not typically present with the combination of sensorineural hearing loss and anterior lenticonus.\n- **Tuberous sclerosis (D)**: This condition is characterized by benign tumors in various organs, skin lesions, and seizures, which do not fit the described symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for these findings is:\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
