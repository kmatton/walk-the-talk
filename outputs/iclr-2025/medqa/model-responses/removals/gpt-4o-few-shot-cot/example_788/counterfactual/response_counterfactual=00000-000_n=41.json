{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an increasing difficulty in hearing over the past several months. His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The vital signs are within normal limits. Laboratory studies show: Serum Urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL Urine Blood 1+ Protein 1+ RBC 15\u201317/hpf WBC 1\u20132/hpf The audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?\nA. Alport syndrome\nB. Fabry\u2019s disease\nC. Von Hippel-Lindau disease\nD. Tuberous sclerosis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Increasing difficulty in hearing**: This suggests a possible sensorineural hearing loss.\n2. **Difficulty reading due to vision problems**: This hints at an ocular issue.\n3. **Family history**: Notable for the father having received a renal transplant, which suggests a potential hereditary renal disorder.\n4. **Laboratory findings**:\n   - Serum Urea nitrogen: 15 mg/dL (normal)\n   - Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL (normal)\n   - Urine: Blood 1+, Protein 1+\n   - RBCs: 15\u201317/hpf (hematuria)\n   - WBCs: 1\u20132/hpf (normal)\n\n5. **Audiometry**: Bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.\n6. **Ophthalmologic examination**: Anterior lenticonus.\n\nConsidering these findings, we need to identify a condition that involves:\n- Sensorineural hearing loss\n- Ocular abnormalities (anterior lenticonus)\n- Renal involvement (hematuria and proteinuria)\n- A possible hereditary pattern given the father\u2019s renal transplant.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n\nA. **Alport syndrome**:\n   - Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting the type IV collagen, leading to kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities such as anterior lenticonus.\n   - The presence of hematuria and proteinuria, along with the family history of renal issues, supports this diagnosis.\n   - Sensorineural hearing loss and anterior lenticonus are classic findings.\n\nB. **Fabry\u2019s disease**:\n   - Fabry\u2019s disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient alpha-galactosidase A. It can lead to renal issues, but the typical ocular findings are corneal verticillata (whorls) rather than anterior lenticonus. Hearing loss is not a primary feature.\n\nC. **Von Hippel-Lindau disease**:\n   - This condition involves tumors and cysts in various parts of the body, including the kidneys, but it is not typically associated with anterior lenticonus or sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nD. **Tuberous sclerosis**:\n   - Tuberous sclerosis involves benign tumors in multiple organs, including the kidneys, brain, and skin. However, it does not typically present with anterior lenticonus or sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nGiven the information and the characteristic findings of Alport syndrome (sensorineural hearing loss, anterior lenticonus, and renal disease with hematuria and proteinuria), the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
