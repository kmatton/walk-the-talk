{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an increasing difficulty in hearing over the past several months. His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show: Serum Urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL Urine Blood 1+ Protein 1+ RBC 15\u201317/hpf WBC 1\u20132/hpf The audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?\nA. Alport syndrome\nB. Fabry\u2019s disease\nC. Von Hippel-Lindau disease\nD. Tuberous sclerosis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, let's analyze the clinical findings and their relevance to the given options.\n\n### Clinical Findings:\n1. **Difficulty in hearing**: This suggests a possible sensorineural hearing loss.\n2. **Difficulty in reading**: This could be due to issues with vision.\n3. **Family history**: The patient's father had a renal transplant in his 20s, suggesting a possible hereditary renal disorder.\n4. **Laboratory results**:\n   - Blood in urine (hematuria)\n   - Protein in urine (proteinuria)\n   - Red Blood Cells (RBCs) in urine.\n5. **Audiometry**: Bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.\n6. **Ophthalmologic examination**: Anterior lenticonus (a bulging of the lens surface).\n\n### Differential Diagnosis:\nLet's look at the options and see which one fits best with the combination of renal, auditory, and ocular findings:\n\n#### A. Alport syndrome\n- **Renal**: Hematuria, proteinuria, and a family history of renal disease are consistent with Alport syndrome.\n- **Auditory**: Sensorineural hearing loss is a hallmark of Alport syndrome.\n- **Ocular**: Anterior lenticonus is highly suggestive of Alport syndrome.\n\n#### B. Fabry\u2019s disease\n- **Renal**: Can present with proteinuria and renal failure.\n- **Auditory**: Hearing loss can occur.\n- **Ocular**: Corneal opacities, but not typically anterior lenticonus.\n- **Other**: Fabry disease often presents with angiokeratomas and pain crises, which are not mentioned here.\n\n#### C. Von Hippel-Lindau disease\n- **Renal**: Associated with renal cysts and renal cell carcinoma rather than early onset renal failure.\n- **Auditory**: Not commonly associated with hearing loss.\n- **Ocular**: Retinal hemangioblastomas are more common than lenticonus.\n\n#### D. Tuberous sclerosis\n- **Renal**: Associated with angiomyolipomas, not typically with early-onset renal failure.\n- **Auditory**: Not typically associated with hearing loss.\n- **Ocular**: Retinal hamartomas, not lenticonus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe combination of hematuria, proteinuria, sensorineural hearing loss, and anterior lenticonus strongly suggests **Alport syndrome**.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
