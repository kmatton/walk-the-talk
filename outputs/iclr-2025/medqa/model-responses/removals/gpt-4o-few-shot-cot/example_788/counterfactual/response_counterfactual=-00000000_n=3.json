{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A boy is brought to the physician because of an increasing difficulty in hearing over the past several months. His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show: Serum Urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL Urine Blood 1+ Protein 1+ RBC 15\u201317/hpf WBC 1\u20132/hpf The audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?\nA. Alport syndrome\nB. Fabry\u2019s disease\nC. Von Hippel-Lindau disease\nD. Tuberous sclerosis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, we need to consider the combination of symptoms and family history:\n\n1. **Hearing Loss**: The boy has bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.\n2. **Vision Problems**: He has difficulty reading because he cannot see the words clearly, and ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus.\n3. **Renal Involvement**: His father received a renal transplant in his 20s, suggesting a potential hereditary renal issue.\n4. **Laboratory Findings**: Urine analysis shows blood (1+), protein (1+), and RBCs (15\u201317/hpf).\n\n### Analysis of Each Option:\n\n- **Alport Syndrome**:\n  - **Hearing Loss**: Sensorineural hearing loss is a classic feature.\n  - **Vision Problems**: Anterior lenticonus (a bulging of the lens) is a hallmark.\n  - **Renal Involvement**: Alport syndrome typically involves progressive renal disease, which aligns with the family history of a renal transplant.\n  - **Laboratory Findings**: Hematuria and proteinuria are common in Alport syndrome.\n\n- **Fabry\u2019s Disease**:\n  - **Hearing Loss**: Can occur but is less characteristic.\n  - **Vision Problems**: Corneal opacities are more common than anterior lenticonus.\n  - **Renal Involvement**: Renal disease can occur but usually presents with pain crises and angiokeratomas.\n  - **Laboratory Findings**: Not typically associated with hematuria and proteinuria in early stages.\n\n- **Von Hippel-Lindau Disease**:\n  - **Hearing Loss**: Not a characteristic feature.\n  - **Vision Problems**: Hemangioblastomas and retinal angiomas are common.\n  - **Renal Involvement**: Renal cell carcinoma and cysts are more characteristic.\n  - **Laboratory Findings**: Would show more specific findings related to tumors.\n\n- **Tuberous Sclerosis**:\n  - **Hearing Loss**: Not a typical feature.\n  - **Vision Problems**: Retinal hamartomas are more common.\n  - **Renal Involvement**: Renal angiomyolipomas are common.\n  - **Laboratory Findings**: Would not typically show hematuria and proteinuria.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the combination of sensorineural hearing loss, anterior lenticonus, and renal involvement with hematuria and proteinuria, **Alport syndrome** is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
