{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 50-year-old man visits his physician after 20 years of not seeking any medical care. He is concerned about his health after a colleague recently had a heart attack. The patient has no active complaints and says he feels healthy; however, he does not exercise regularly and lives a sedentary lifestyle. He is employed as an administrative position at a local college, and is seated at a desk most of the day. His father had a heart attack at age 54 and his mother is still alive with no health concerns. He does not smoke, only drinks socially, and does not use drugs. Today, his blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical examination reveals an obese male with no significant findings. An ECG shows no abnormalities, and laboratory testing shows the following: Urinalysis  Glucose  negative Ketones negative Leucocytes negative Nitrites negative  Red blood cells (RBC) negative  Casts negative Which of the following lab abnormalities in this patient is an indication for treatment?\nA. Blood pressure reading\nB. Patient\u2019s weight\nC. High LDL-cholesterol\nD. Serum glucose level\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine which lab abnormality in this patient is an indication for treatment, we need to consider the provided information. The patient is obese, has a blood pressure reading of 130/90 mm Hg, and no significant physical examination findings apart from his weight. An ECG shows no abnormalities, and urinalysis results are normal. However, the laboratory testing results mentioned do not include the LDL-cholesterol or serum glucose values, which are critical in assessing cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n1. **Blood pressure reading:** The patient has a blood pressure of 130/90 mm Hg, which falls into the category of stage 1 hypertension according to the American Heart Association guidelines. Lifestyle modifications and potential pharmacotherapy may be needed to manage this condition.\n\n2. **Patient\u2019s weight:** While the patient is obese and weight management is important, obesity itself is not a direct indication for immediate pharmacological treatment but rather for lifestyle intervention.\n\n3. **High LDL-cholesterol:** Assuming the patient has elevated LDL-cholesterol, this is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and would be an indication for treatment to lower cholesterol levels, especially with his family history of heart disease.\n\n4. **Serum glucose level:** The urinalysis does not show glucose, implying there is no glucose spillage in the urine, which suggests that the serum glucose level might be within normal range. However, without exact serum glucose values, we cannot definitively assess this.\n\nGiven the patient\u2019s sedentary lifestyle, obesity, family history of heart attack, and potential risk for cardiovascular disease, the most likely laboratory abnormality needing treatment would be elevated LDL-cholesterol, if present.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
