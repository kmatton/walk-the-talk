{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 50-year-old man visits his physician after 20 years of not seeking any medical care. He is concerned about his health after a colleague recently had a heart attack. The patient has no active complaints and says he feels healthy; however, he does not exercise regularly and lives a sedentary lifestyle. He is employed as an administrative position at a local college, and is seated at a desk most of the day. His father had a heart attack at age 54 and his mother is still alive with no health concerns. He only drinks socially and does not use drugs. Today, his blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical examination reveals an obese male with no significant findings. An ECG shows no abnormalities, and laboratory testing shows the following: Laboratory test Serum glucose (fasting)  105 mg/dL Serum electrolytes  Sodium  142 mEq/L Potassium 3.9 mEq/L Chloride 101 mEq/L Serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl Blood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dl Cholesterol, total 250 mg/dL HDL-cholesterol 35 mg/dL LDL-cholesterol 186 mg/dL Triglycerides 170 mg/dL Urinalysis  Glucose  negative Ketones negative Leucocytes negative Nitrites negative  Red blood cells (RBC) negative  Casts negative Which of the following lab abnormalities in this patient is an indication for treatment?\nA. Blood pressure reading\nB. Patient\u2019s weight\nC. High LDL-cholesterol\nD. Serum glucose level\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the indication for treatment in this patient, let's analyze the provided data:\n\n**Vital Signs and Examination:**\n- Blood pressure: 130/90 mm Hg (prehypertension)\n- Pulse: 84/min\n- Respiratory rate: 14/min\n- Physical examination: reveals obesity\n\n**Laboratory Findings:**\n1. **Fasting Serum Glucose:**\n   - 105 mg/dL (prediabetes, normal range: <100 mg/dL, prediabetes: 100-125 mg/dL, diabetes: \u2265126 mg/dL)\n\n2. **Serum Electrolytes:**\n   - Sodium: 142 mEq/L (normal range: 135-145 mEq/L)\n   - Potassium: 3.9 mEq/L (normal range: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L)\n   - Chloride: 101 mEq/L (normal range: 96-106 mEq/L)\n\n3. **Serum Creatinine:**\n   - 0.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6-1.2 mg/dL)\n\n4. **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):**\n   - 10 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)\n\n5. **Cholesterol:**\n   - Total cholesterol: 250 mg/dL (high, desirable: <200 mg/dL, borderline high: 200-239 mg/dL, high: \u2265240 mg/dL)\n   - HDL-cholesterol: 35 mg/dL (low, normal: \u226540 mg/dL for men)\n   - LDL-cholesterol: 186 mg/dL (very high, optimal: <100 mg/dL, near optimal: 100-129 mg/dL, borderline high: 130-159 mg/dL, high: 160-189 mg/dL, very high: \u2265190 mg/dL)\n   - Triglycerides: 170 mg/dL (borderline high, normal: <150 mg/dL, borderline high: 150-199 mg/dL, high: 200-499 mg/dL, very high: \u2265500 mg/dL)\n\n6. **Urinalysis:**\n   - Negative for glucose, ketones, leukocytes, nitrites, RBCs, and casts.\n\nFrom the above information, the patient's LDL-cholesterol level is significantly elevated, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and an indication for treatment. Given his family history of heart disease and current cholesterol levels, it is critical to address this risk factor.\n\n**Answer: C**", "answer": "C"}
