{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions.

He is concerned about his health after a colleague recently had a heart attack. The patient has no active complaints and says he feels healthy; however, he does not exercise regularly and lives a sedentary lifestyle. He is employed as an administrative position at a local college, and is seated at a desk most of the day. His father had a heart attack at age 54 and his mother is still alive with no health concerns. He does not smoke, only drinks socially, and does not use drugs. Today, his blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical examination reveals an obese male with no significant findings. An ECG shows no abnormalities, and laboratory testing shows the following: Urinalysis  Glucose  negative Ketones negative Leucocytes negative Nitrites negative  Red blood cells (RBC) negative  Casts negative Which of the following lab abnormalities in this patient is an indication for treatment?\nA. Blood pressure reading\nB. Patient\u2019s weight\nC. High LDL-cholesterol\nD. Serum glucose level\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Given the patient's presentation and family history, we need to identify the lab abnormality that warrants immediate treatment. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Blood pressure reading: The patient has a blood pressure reading of 130/90 mm Hg. While this is in the range of stage 1 hypertension, lifestyle modifications are often recommended before starting pharmacotherapy unless the patient has other risk factors or target organ damage.\n\nB. Patient\u2019s weight: The physical examination reveals the patient is obese, which is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, weight management primarily involves lifestyle changes rather than immediate pharmacotherapy.\n\nC. High LDL-cholesterol: The laboratory results provided in the question do not include cholesterol levels. However, given the patient\u2019s sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and family history of early heart attack, it is likely that the patient may have elevated LDL-cholesterol, which should be addressed.\n\nD. Serum glucose level: The urinalysis results show that glucose is negative, indicating there is no immediate concern for diabetes from the given data.\n\nGiven the patient's concern about heart disease, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and family history, the most critical lab abnormality that would indicate the need for treatment is likely to be high LDL-cholesterol. Elevated LDL-cholesterol significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular events and would necessitate medical intervention.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
