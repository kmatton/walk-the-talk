{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 50-year-old man visits his physician after 20 years of not seeking any medical care. He is concerned about his health after a colleague recently had a heart attack. The patient has no active complaints and says he feels healthy; however, he does not exercise regularly and lives a sedentary lifestyle. He is employed as an administrative position at a local college, and is seated at a desk most of the day. His father had a heart attack at age 54 and his mother is still alive with no health concerns. He does not smoke, only drinks socially, and does not use drugs. Today, his blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical examination reveals an obese male with no significant findings. An ECG shows no abnormalities, and laboratory testing shows the following:\nLaboratory test\nSerum glucose (fasting)  105 mg/dL\nSerum electrolytes \nSodium  142 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nChloride 101 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl\nBlood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dl\nCholesterol, total 250 mg/dL\nHDL-cholesterol 35 mg/dL\nLDL-cholesterol 186 mg/dL\nTriglycerides 170 mg/dL\nUrinalysis \nGlucose  negative\nKetones negative\nLeucocytes negative\nNitrites negative \nRed blood cells (RBC) negative \nCasts negative \nWhich of the following lab abnormalities in this patient is an indication for treatment?\nA. Blood pressure reading\nB. Patient\u2019s weight\nC. High LDL-cholesterol\nD. Serum glucose level\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine which lab abnormality is an indication for treatment, we need to analyze each given parameter and compare them to standard treatment guidelines.\n\n1. **Blood pressure reading**: The patient's blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. This is classified as Stage 1 Hypertension according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, which is an indication for lifestyle modifications and possibly pharmacologic treatment depending on the overall cardiovascular risk.\n\n2. **Patient\u2019s weight**: The patient's weight is not directly provided, but he is described as obese. While obesity is a significant risk factor for various conditions, it is not treated as a lab abnormality itself, but rather through lifestyle changes to reduce overall cardiovascular risk.\n\n3. **High LDL-cholesterol**: The patient's LDL-cholesterol is 186 mg/dL. According to the ACC/AHA guidelines, an LDL level above 190 mg/dL is a clear indication for high-intensity statin therapy. Although his LDL is slightly below this threshold, given his family history of premature heart disease and other risk factors (e.g., obesity, high blood pressure), he would likely benefit from treatment to lower LDL cholesterol.\n\n4. **Serum glucose level**: The patient's fasting serum glucose level is 105 mg/dL. This falls into the category of impaired fasting glucose (100-125 mg/dL), which is indicative of prediabetes. While this is a risk factor for developing diabetes, it does not typically warrant immediate pharmacologic treatment but rather lifestyle interventions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most significant lab abnormality that indicates the need for treatment is the high LDL-cholesterol, especially in the context of his cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
