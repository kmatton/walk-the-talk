{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 26-year-old woman comes to the clinic for an annual wellness examination. She is healthy with no prior history of significant illness. She eats a plant-based diet with no carbonated drinks. When asked if anything is bothering her, she reports that she has been having recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes for the past year. She denies any fever, sick contacts, cough, headaches, chest pain, urinary symptoms, or constipation/diarrhea during these episodes. She is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed. What is the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question?\nA. Alpha-adrenergic agonist\nB. Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors\nC. Disruption of disulfide bonds\nD. Short acting beta-2 agonist\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "Given the symptoms of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes, the patient is likely experiencing allergic rhinitis. The most common medications prescribed to alleviate these symptoms are antihistamines.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. **Alpha-adrenergic agonist**: These are typically used in nasal decongestants (e.g., phenylephrine), but they do not address sneezing and itchy eyes effectively.\n\nB. **Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors**: This is the mechanism of anticholinergic drugs, which are not first-line treatments for allergic rhinitis symptoms.\n\nC. **Disruption of disulfide bonds**: This mechanism is associated with mucolytic agents (e.g., N-acetylcysteine), which are used to break down mucus, not to relieve sneezing and itchy eyes.\n\nD. **Short acting beta-2 agonist**: These are bronchodilators used in asthma and other respiratory conditions, not for treating allergic rhinitis.\n\nThe most appropriate medication for allergic rhinitis is an antihistamine, which works by blocking histamine receptors (H1 receptors). The mechanism of action for these medications involves competitive blockage of histamine receptors, not muscarinic receptors. However, since \"competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors\" does not fit, the correct answer should focus on the primary action of antihistamines in relieving allergic symptoms by targeting histamine receptors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\n**E. Competitive blockage of histamine receptors (H1 receptor antagonists)**\n\nSince this specific option is not listed, the closest and most relevant mechanism of action for the prescribed medication in treating allergic rhinitis symptoms is:\n\n**A. Alpha-adrenergic agonist** (for nasal decongestion, though it doesn't fully address all symptoms like sneezing and itchy eyes).\n\nGiven the options provided, there might be a slight mismatch, but for the most accurate mechanism, the answer should ideally be related to antihistamines and histamine receptor blockage.", "answer": "A"}
