{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 26-year-old woman comes to the clinic for an annual wellness examination. She is healthy with no prior history of significant illness. She exercises 3-4 times a week and eats a plant-based diet with no carbonated drinks. When asked if anything is bothering her, she denies any fever, sick contacts, cough, headaches, chest pain, urinary symptoms, or constipation/diarrhea during these episodes. She is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed. What is the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question?\nA. Alpha-adrenergic agonist\nB. Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors\nC. Disruption of disulfide bonds\nD. Short acting beta-2 agonist\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the correct answer, we must first identify the likely condition the patient is experiencing, given the information provided. Although the patient denies significant symptoms typically associated with acute illnesses, the instruction to take medication \"as needed\" suggests a condition that might flare up intermittently but isn't currently causing major symptoms. \n\nA few considerations could help us narrow down the options:\n\n1. **Alpha-adrenergic agonist**: These medications are often used for nasal congestion or hypotension, conditions that are not indicated by the patient's history.\n  \n2. **Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors**: This mechanism is typical of anticholinergic drugs, which are used to treat conditions like overactive bladder, motion sickness, and sometimes for peptic ulcers or COPD.\n  \n3. **Disruption of disulfide bonds**: This is the mechanism of mucolytics like N-acetylcysteine, used for conditions involving thick mucus, such as cystic fibrosis or chronic bronchitis.\n  \n4. **Short-acting beta-2 agonist**: These are commonly used for acute bronchospasm in conditions like asthma or COPD.\n\nGiven that the patient is healthy, exercises regularly, and consumes a plant-based diet, it is unlikely she has a chronic condition like asthma or COPD. Therefore, a short-acting beta-2 agonist seems less likely. \n\nThe absence of significant symptoms like fever, cough, headache, and urinary symptoms makes conditions requiring mucolytics or alpha-adrenergic agonists less likely. \n\nConsidering the options, a competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors could be used for more non-specific, intermittent symptoms that don't clearly point to the other options, such as overactive bladder or motion sickness, which might not have been explicitly discussed in the patient\u2019s history but fit the criteria of requiring \"as needed\" medication.\n\nThus, the most plausible option is:\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "D"}
