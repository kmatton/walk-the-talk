{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 26-year-old woman comes to the clinic. She is healthy with no prior history of significant illness. She exercises 3-4 times a week and eats a plant-based diet with no carbonated drinks. When asked if anything is bothering her, she reports that she has been having recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes for the past year. She denies any fever, sick contacts, cough, headaches, chest pain, urinary symptoms, or constipation/diarrhea during these episodes. She is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed. What is the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question?\nA. Alpha-adrenergic agonist\nB. Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors\nC. Disruption of disulfide bonds\nD. Short acting beta-2 agonist\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "To solve the question, we need to identify which medication is commonly used to treat the symptoms of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes associated with allergic reactions and understand its mechanism of action.\n\nThe symptoms described (sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes) are typical of allergic rhinitis, and the treatment for these symptoms often involves antihistamines.\n\n- **Alpha-adrenergic agonist**: Medications like nasal decongestants (e.g., phenylephrine) fall under this category, but they primarily relieve nasal congestion and not the full spectrum of allergic symptoms like sneezing and itchy eyes.\n- **Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors**: This is the mechanism of action for anticholinergic drugs. These drugs are not typically used for allergic rhinitis.\n- **Disruption of disulfide bonds**: This mechanism pertains to mucolytics, which are used to break down mucus, not to alleviate allergic symptoms.\n- **Short acting beta-2 agonist**: These drugs (e.g., albuterol) are used for bronchospasm relief in conditions like asthma, not for allergic rhinitis symptoms.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors**: This is incorrect. Anticholinergic drugs are not typically used for allergic rhinitis.\n\n**Alpha-adrenergic agonist**: This is not the best choice since it primarily addresses nasal congestion.\n\n**Disruption of disulfide bonds**: This is incorrect as it pertains to mucolytics.\n\n**Short acting beta-2 agonist**: This is incorrect as it is used for bronchodilation in asthma.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**Competitive inhibition of H1 receptors**: Antihistamines (like loratadine, cetirizine) work by blocking H1 histamine receptors, alleviating sneezing, itching, and runny nose associated with allergic rhinitis.\n\nAnswer: **B. Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors**\n\nThis answer would be corrected to the true medication mechanism:\n\n**H1 receptor antagonism** for antihistamines.", "answer": "B"}
