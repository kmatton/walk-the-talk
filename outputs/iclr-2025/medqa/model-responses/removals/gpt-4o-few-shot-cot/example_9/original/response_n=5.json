{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 26-year-old woman comes to the clinic for an annual wellness examination. She is healthy with no prior history of significant illness. She exercises 3-4 times a week and eats a plant-based diet with no carbonated drinks. When asked if anything is bothering her, she reports that she has been having recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes for the past year. She denies any fever, sick contacts, cough, headaches, chest pain, urinary symptoms, or constipation/diarrhea during these episodes. She is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed. What is the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question?\nA. Alpha-adrenergic agonist\nB. Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors\nC. Disruption of disulfide bonds\nD. Short acting beta-2 agonist\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "The patient's symptoms of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes are consistent with allergic rhinitis. The likely mechanism of action of the medication prescribed for these symptoms would be one that targets the histamine receptors involved in allergic reactions. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Alpha-adrenergic agonist**: These are typically used as decongestants (e.g., phenylephrine) and help by vasoconstriction to reduce nasal congestion. However, they do not address sneezing and itchy eyes directly.\n\nB. **Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors**: Medications that block muscarinic receptors are anticholinergics (e.g., atropine). These are not typically used for allergic rhinitis symptoms.\n\nC. **Disruption of disulfide bonds**: This mechanism is associated with mucolytics (e.g., acetylcysteine), which are used to break down mucus in conditions like chronic bronchitis, not for allergic rhinitis.\n\nD. **Short-acting beta-2 agonist**: These medications (e.g., albuterol) are used for asthma to relax bronchial muscles, not for allergic rhinitis symptoms.\n\nTo alleviate allergic rhinitis symptoms such as sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes, the most appropriate medications are antihistamines, which work by blocking histamine receptors (H1 receptors) and thereby reducing the effects of histamine released during allergic reactions.\n\nGiven the options and what we know about treatment for allergic rhinitis, the correct answer should be:\nA. **Alpha-adrenergic agonist**\n\nHowever, if the medication were an antihistamine (which is not an option here), the competitive blockage of histamine receptors would be the correct mechanism. Given the choices provided, an alpha-adrenergic agonist (like a nasal decongestant) could somewhat alleviate the congestion, but it is not a comprehensive treatment for all symptoms described.", "answer": "A"}
