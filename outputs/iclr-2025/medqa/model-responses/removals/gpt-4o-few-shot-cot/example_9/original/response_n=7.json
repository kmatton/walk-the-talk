{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 26-year-old woman comes to the clinic for an annual wellness examination. She is healthy with no prior history of significant illness. She exercises 3-4 times a week and eats a plant-based diet with no carbonated drinks. When asked if anything is bothering her, she reports that she has been having recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes for the past year. She denies any fever, sick contacts, cough, headaches, chest pain, urinary symptoms, or constipation/diarrhea during these episodes. She is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed. What is the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question?\nA. Alpha-adrenergic agonist\nB. Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors\nC. Disruption of disulfide bonds\nD. Short acting beta-2 agonist\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "Given the patient's symptoms of recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes, the most likely diagnosis is allergic rhinitis. The treatment for allergic rhinitis typically involves antihistamines, which work by blocking histamine receptors (primarily H1 receptors) to reduce allergy symptoms.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Alpha-adrenergic agonist**: These medications (like pseudoephedrine) are decongestants that can reduce nasal congestion by vasoconstriction, but they do not address sneezing and itchy eyes, which are mediated by histamine.\n\nB. **Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors**: These medications (like atropine) are typically used for conditions such as bradycardia or to reduce secretions pre-operatively. They are not the first line for allergic rhinitis.\n\nC. **Disruption of disulfide bonds**: Medications that disrupt disulfide bonds (like mucolytics) are used to thin mucus in conditions such as chronic bronchitis or cystic fibrosis, not for allergic rhinitis.\n\nD. **Short acting beta-2 agonist**: These medications (like albuterol) are used for asthma to relax bronchial smooth muscle and relieve bronchospasm, not for the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**B. Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors**\n\nHowever, since the mechanism described above does not directly align with the common treatment for allergic rhinitis, the most accurate mechanism given the context would be:\n\n**Antihistamines** block histamine receptors (H1 receptors) to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis. The competitive blockage of histamine receptors (H1 antagonists) is the standard treatment for allergic rhinitis.\n\nTherefore, the correct mechanism of action should be:\n\nCompetitive blockage of **histamine** receptors.\n\nAnswer: B. Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors (if considering the antihistamine mechanism indirectly)", "answer": "B"}
