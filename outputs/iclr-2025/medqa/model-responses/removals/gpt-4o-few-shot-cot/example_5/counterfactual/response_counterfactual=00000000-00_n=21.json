{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 70-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension returns to his cardiologist for ongoing blood pressure management. He reports feeling fine with no trouble with his medications. He exercises regularly and sleeps well without snoring or daytime somnolence. His blood pressure measurements in the past have ranged from 160 - 170/80 - 100 mmHg. Physical exam reveals a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 is appreciated at the right upper sternal border. There is unremarkable carotid, renal, or abdominal bruits. What is the most common cause of his hypertension?\nA. Primary hyperaldosteronism\nB. Hypothyroidism\nC. Stiffening of the aorta\nD. Aortic stenosis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most common cause of hypertension in a 70-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension presenting with a blood pressure range of 160-170/80-100 mmHg and a physical exam indicating a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 at the right upper sternal border, we need to consider the clinical signs and underlying pathophysiology.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Primary hyperaldosteronism: This condition commonly causes resistant hypertension and may present with hypokalemia, but there are no specific mentions of these in the patient's history or exam.\n\nB. Hypothyroidism: While hypothyroidism can contribute to hypertension, it is more typically associated with diastolic hypertension and other symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance, which are not reported in this case.\n\nC. Stiffening of the aorta: This is a common age-related change that can lead to isolated systolic hypertension, which aligns well with the patient's systolic blood pressure reading of 160-170 mmHg. Stiffening of the aorta leads to increased systolic blood pressure due to decreased arterial compliance.\n\nD. Aortic stenosis: The presence of a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border (indicative of aortic stenosis) is noted. However, aortic stenosis typically leads to a specific pattern of heart sounds and symptoms such as angina, syncope, and heart failure, none of which are mentioned in this case. Moreover, aortic stenosis is not the most common cause of hypertension.\n\nGiven that the patient's blood pressure pattern and age-related vascular changes align most closely with stiffening of the aorta, this is the most likely common cause.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
