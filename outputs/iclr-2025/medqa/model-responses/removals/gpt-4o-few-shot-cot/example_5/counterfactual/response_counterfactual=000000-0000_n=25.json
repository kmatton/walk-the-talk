{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 70-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension returns to his cardiologist for ongoing blood pressure management. He reports feeling fine with no trouble with his medications. He exercises regularly. His blood pressure measurements in the past have ranged from 160 - 170/80 - 100 mmHg. Today, his pressure is 150/100 mmHg with a pulse of 65/min while on hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril. Physical exam reveals a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 is appreciated at the right upper sternal border. There is unremarkable carotid, renal, or abdominal bruits. What is the most common cause of his hypertension?\nA. Primary hyperaldosteronism\nB. Hypothyroidism\nC. Stiffening of the aorta\nD. Aortic stenosis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's carefully analyze the given patient's symptoms and examination findings to determine the most likely cause of his hypertension.\n\nThe patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and his blood pressure has been persistently elevated despite being on two antihypertensive medications (hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril). His blood pressure today is still elevated at 150/100 mmHg. \n\nThe physical exam reveals an early systolic murmur with a split S2 at the right upper sternal border, but no significant bruits in the carotid, renal, or abdominal areas.\n\nHere's the analysis of each option:\n\nA. **Primary hyperaldosteronism**: Typically presents with resistant hypertension and hypokalemia. There is no mention of electrolyte abnormalities here, making this less likely.\n\nB. **Hypothyroidism**: This condition can cause diastolic hypertension, but the patient's history and examination do not provide any evidence pointing towards hypothyroidism (e.g., no mention of fatigue, weight gain, or other symptoms of hypothyroidism).\n\nC. **Stiffening of the aorta**: This is a common cause of isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly due to reduced compliance of the aorta and other large arteries. This could fit the patient's history of persistently elevated systolic blood pressure.\n\nD. **Aortic stenosis**: The murmur described (early systolic murmur with split S2 at the right upper sternal border) could suggest aortic stenosis. However, aortic stenosis would typically present with symptoms like exertional dyspnea, chest pain, or syncope, which are not mentioned here. Additionally, aortic stenosis usually presents with a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, not just an early systolic murmur.\n\nGiven the information, **stiffening of the aorta** (C) is the most likely cause of his hypertension, considering his age and the nature of his elevated systolic blood pressure.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
