{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 70-year-old man returns to his cardiologist for ongoing blood pressure management. He reports feeling fine with no trouble with his medications. He exercises regularly and sleeps well without snoring or daytime somnolence. His blood pressure measurements in the past have ranged from 160 - 170/80 - 100 mmHg. Today, his pressure is 150/100 mmHg with a pulse of 65/min while on hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril. Physical exam reveals a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 is appreciated at the right upper sternal border. There is unremarkable carotid, renal, or abdominal bruits. What is the most common cause of his hypertension?\nA. Primary hyperaldosteronism\nB. Hypothyroidism\nC. Stiffening of the aorta\nD. Aortic stenosis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most common cause of the patient's hypertension, we need to evaluate the clinical findings and the patient's history. \n\n1. **Primary Hyperaldosteronism**: This condition is characterized by excessive production of aldosterone, leading to hypertension and often hypokalemia. There is no indication of hypokalemia or other signs of hyperaldosteronism in the patient's history or lab results.\n\n2. **Hypothyroidism**: Hypothyroidism can cause secondary hypertension due to increased peripheral vascular resistance. However, there are no signs or symptoms suggesting hypothyroidism in this patient (e.g., fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance).\n\n3. **Stiffening of the Aorta**: This refers to the loss of elasticity of the aorta, causing increased systolic blood pressure, particularly in older adults. The patient's age and persistent systolic hypertension despite treatment suggest this as a potential cause.\n\n4. **Aortic Stenosis**: The patient has a systolic murmur and split S2, which could be associated with aortic stenosis. However, aortic stenosis typically causes a high-pitched, crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and is more likely to present with symptoms such as angina, syncope, or heart failure. The patient's hypertension is more consistent with age-related vascular changes rather than aortic stenosis.\n\nGiven the patient's age and the nature of his hypertension, stiffening of the aorta is the most likely cause.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
