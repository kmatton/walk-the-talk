Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a \u201cheavy feeling\u201d in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To answer this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and history:\n\n1. **Increasingly Heavy Periods and Irregular Cycles**: The patient reports soaking a super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days, indicating menorrhagia. Additionally, there is intermenstrual bleeding.\n2. **Significant Dysmenorrhea**: Painful menstruation requiring frequent use of ibuprofen.\n3. **New Onset Mild Dyspareunia and Pelvic \"Heavy Feeling\"**: These symptoms suggest the presence of a pelvic mass or uterine enlargement.\n4. **Increased Urinary Frequency**: This can be due to pressure on the bladder from an enlarged uterus.\n5. **Past Medical History**: Includes obesity and type II diabetes, which can be associated with endometrial hyperplasia or uterine fibroids.\n\nGiven these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is a condition causing uterine enlargement, such as uterine fibroids (leiomyomas). \n\n- **A. Globular 10-week sized uterus**: A uniformly enlarged uterus, often seen with adenomyosis, characterized by a \"globular\" enlargement.\n- **B. Adnexal mass**: Suggestive of ovarian pathology, not fitting the clinical picture as closely.\n- **C. Irregular 14-week sized uterus**: Typically associated with multiple fibroids, which cause an asymmetrically enlarged, irregular uterus.\n- **D. No remarkable physical exam finding**: Unlikely, given the significant symptoms and clinical history.\n\nConsidering the clinical presentation and the most likely underlying condition (uterine fibroids), the physical exam finding most consistent with this would be an irregularly enlarged uterus.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
