Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the symptoms and physical examination findings to determine the most likely condition and corresponding physical exam finding.\n\n1. **Symptoms:**\n   - Increasingly heavy periods (menorrhagia)\n   - Irregular cycles with intermenstrual bleeding\n   - Significant dysmenorrhea\n   - Mild dyspareunia (pain during intercourse)\n   - \"Heavy feeling\" in the pelvis\n   - Increased urinary frequency\n\n2. **Patient History:**\n   - Obesity and type II diabetes\n   - Multiparous (five spontaneous vaginal deliveries)\n\n3. **Physical signs to consider:**\n   - Menorrhagia, irregular bleeding, and dysmenorrhea can be associated with various gynecological conditions such as fibroids (leiomyomas), adenomyosis, endometrial hyperplasia, or malignancy.\n\n4. **Possible conditions based on symptoms:**\n   - **Fibroids (uterine leiomyomas):** These are benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus. They can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, and urinary frequency. A physical exam might reveal an irregularly enlarged uterus.\n   - **Adenomyosis:** This condition involves endometrial tissue within the myometrium, which can cause heavy periods, pain, and an enlarged, tender uterus, often described as \"globular.\"\n   - **Endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy:** These can also present with abnormal bleeding but less likely to cause an enlarged uterus compared to fibroids or adenomyosis.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the typical presentation of these conditions:\n\n- **Fibroids (irregular 14-week sized uterus):** The irregularity and size of the uterus can be detected during a physical exam.\n- **Adenomyosis (globular 10-week sized uterus):** A uniformly enlarged, globular uterus is typical for adenomyosis.\n\nConsidering the presence of significant symptoms related to uterine enlargement and the common presentation of fibroids in women of reproductive age with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pressure, the most likely physical exam finding in this patient is an **irregular 14-week sized uterus**.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
