Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Given the patient's symptoms of increasingly heavy periods, irregular cycles, significant dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a heavy feeling in the pelvis, and increased urinary frequency, the most likely cause points toward a uterine abnormality. The patient's history of obesity and type II diabetes can be associated with conditions like uterine fibroids or adenomyosis. \n\nAmong the options:\n\nA. **Globular 10-week sized uterus** - This description fits well with adenomyosis, which typically presents with a uniformly enlarged uterus.\nB. **Adnexal mass** - This would suggest an ovarian pathology such as an ovarian cyst or tumor, which doesn't quite fit the patient's primary symptoms.\nC. **Irregular 14-week sized uterus** - This is characteristic of uterine fibroids, which can cause heavy bleeding, irregular cycles, and pelvic pressure.\nD. **No remarkable physical exam finding** - Given the significant symptoms, it's unlikely that the physical exam would be unremarkable.\n\nConsidering the symptoms and the physical findings that would be most consistent with the patient's presentation, an **irregular 14-week sized uterus** suggesting uterine fibroids is the most likely finding.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
