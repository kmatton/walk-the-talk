{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a \u201cheavy feeling\u201d in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely physical exam finding, let's review the patient's symptoms and medical history: \n\n- She reports heavy periods, significant dysmenorrhea, mild dyspareunia, a \"heavy feeling\" in her pelvis, and increased urinary frequency.\n- Her medical history includes obesity and type II diabetes.\n- She has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries.\n\nGiven these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is uterine fibroids (leiomyomas). Uterine fibroids are common in women of reproductive age and can present with heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), pelvic pressure or pain, and urinary frequency.\n\nFibroids can cause the uterus to enlarge, and the size of the uterus is often estimated in terms of weeks of gestation.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus \u2013 This suggests a uniformly enlarged uterus, which can occur with fibroids.\nB. Adnexal mass \u2013 This is more suggestive of ovarian pathology rather than uterine fibroids.\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus \u2013 This suggests an irregularly enlarged uterus, which is also consistent with fibroids.\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding \u2013 This is unlikely given her symptoms and the likely presence of fibroids.\n\nConsidering the patient\u2019s symptoms and the typical presentation of uterine fibroids, the most likely physical exam finding is an irregularly enlarged uterus.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
