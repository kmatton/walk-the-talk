The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely physical exam finding in this patient, we need to consider her symptoms and medical history.\n\n- **Increasingly heavy periods** (menorrhagia)\n- **Significant dysmenorrhea**\n- New onset mild **dyspareunia**\n- A \u201cheavy feeling\u201d in her pelvis\n- Increased **urinary frequency**\n- Past medical history of **obesity** and **type II diabetes**\n- Multiple pregnancies and deliveries\n\nThese symptoms are suggestive of uterine pathology. The most likely conditions that could present with these symptoms include uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) and adenomyosis.\n\nGiven her history of heavy bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and a feeling of pelvic heaviness, the most likely diagnosis is **adenomyosis**. Adenomyosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue within the myometrium, leading to a uniformly enlarged, **globular uterus**.\n\n- **A. Globular 10-week sized uterus**: This is most consistent with adenomyosis, which presents with a diffusely enlarged uterus.\n- **B. Adnexal mass**: Typically associated with ovarian pathology, which does not align with her symptoms.\n- **C. Irregular 14-week sized uterus**: This is more characteristic of uterine fibroids, which cause an irregularly enlarged uterus.\n- **D. No remarkable physical exam finding**: This option is less likely given the described symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the most likely physical exam finding in this patient is a **globular 10-week sized uterus**.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
