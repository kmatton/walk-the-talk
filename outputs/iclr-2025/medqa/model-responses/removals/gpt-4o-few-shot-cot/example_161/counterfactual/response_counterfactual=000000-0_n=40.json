{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions.

She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a \u201cheavy feeling\u201d in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely physical exam finding in this patient, let's consider the details provided:\n\n1. **Heavy and Irregular Periods**: The patient reports increasingly heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) and irregular cycles with intermenstrual bleeding.\n2. **Dysmenorrhea and Pelvic Pressure**: She experiences significant menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea) and a \"heavy feeling\" in her pelvis.\n3. **Dyspareunia and Urinary Frequency**: She has new onset mild pain during intercourse (dyspareunia) and increased urinary frequency.\n4. **History of Multiple Deliveries**: She has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries.\n\nThese symptoms are suggestive of a condition affecting the uterus. The key symptom here is the \"heavy feeling\" in the pelvis, which is often associated with uterine enlargement.\n\nGiven the choices:\n\n- **A. Globular 10-week sized uterus**: This finding is commonly associated with adenomyosis, which can cause a uniformly enlarged uterus and symptoms of heavy, painful periods.\n- **B. Adnexal mass**: This could suggest an ovarian cyst or tumor, which might not typically present with the described symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic heaviness.\n- **C. Irregular 14-week sized uterus**: This is characteristic of uterine fibroids (leiomyomas), which can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular cycles, pelvic pressure, and an irregularly enlarged uterus.\n- **D. No remarkable physical exam finding**: This seems unlikely given the significant symptoms described.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and the physical findings typically associated with these conditions, the most likely diagnosis is uterine fibroids. These are benign tumors of the uterus that can cause the symptoms described, including heavy and irregular bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pressure. They result in an irregularly enlarged uterus on examination.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
