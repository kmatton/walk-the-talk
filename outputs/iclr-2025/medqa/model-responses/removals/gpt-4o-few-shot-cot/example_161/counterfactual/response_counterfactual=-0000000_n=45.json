{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a \u201cheavy feeling\u201d in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve the question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and medical history to identify the most likely physical exam finding.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Patient's Complaints:**\n   - Heavy menstrual bleeding (soaking a super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days).\n   - Irregular cycles with intermenstrual bleeding.\n   - Significant dysmenorrhea.\n   - Mild dyspareunia.\n   - Heavy feeling in the pelvis.\n   - Increased urinary frequency.\n\n2. **Past Medical History:**\n   - Obesity.\n   - Type II diabetes on metformin.\n   - Five spontaneous vaginal deliveries.\n\n3. **Vital Signs:**\n   - Temperature: 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C).\n   - Blood pressure: 137/84 mmHg.\n   - Pulse: 87/min.\n   - Respirations: 14/min.\n\n4. **Differential Diagnosis:**\n   - The symptoms of heavy and irregular menstrual bleeding, significant dysmenorrhea, and a feeling of heaviness in the pelvis are suggestive of a uterine abnormality.\n   - Possible conditions include uterine fibroids (leiomyomas), adenomyosis, or endometrial hyperplasia.\n\n5. **Physical Exam Findings Expected in Each Option:**\n   - **A. Globular 10-week sized uterus:** This is typical of adenomyosis, where the uterus becomes uniformly enlarged and globular.\n   - **B. Adnexal mass:** This could be suggestive of ovarian cysts or tumors, but the symptoms predominantly point to a uterine issue.\n   - **C. Irregular 14-week sized uterus:** This is more characteristic of uterine fibroids, where the uterus may become irregularly enlarged due to the presence of multiple fibroid tumors.\n   - **D. No remarkable physical exam finding:** Given the significant symptoms, it is unlikely that there would be no remarkable physical finding.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely physical exam finding would be an irregularly enlarged uterus, indicative of uterine fibroids (leiomyomas).\n\n**Answer: C**", "answer": "C"}
