Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question step-by-step, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and how they relate to potential gynecological conditions.\n\n1. **Symptoms**:\n   - Increasingly heavy periods over six months (menorrhagia)\n   - Significant dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation)\n   - New onset mild dyspareunia (painful intercourse)\n   - \"Heavy feeling\" in her pelvis\n   - Increased urinary frequency\n\n2. **History**:\n   - Obesity\n   - Type II diabetes\n   - Five spontaneous vaginal deliveries\n\n3. **Physical Exam**:\n   - Temperature: 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C)\n   - Blood pressure: 137/84 mmHg\n   - Pulse: 87/min\n   - Respirations: 14/min\n\n4. **Possible Diagnoses**:\n   - **Fibroids (Leiomyomas)**: These are benign tumors of the uterus that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pressure, and increased urinary frequency. Fibroids often lead to an enlarged and irregularly shaped uterus.\n   - **Endometriosis**: This condition can cause dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia but is less likely to cause a significantly enlarged uterus.\n   - **Adenomyosis**: This can cause a globular and symmetrically enlarged uterus, which can present with menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea.\n   - **Ovarian masses/cysts**: These can cause pelvic pain and dyspareunia but are less likely to cause heavy menstrual bleeding.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is uterine fibroids (leiomyomas), which would present with an irregularly enlarged uterus. \n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
