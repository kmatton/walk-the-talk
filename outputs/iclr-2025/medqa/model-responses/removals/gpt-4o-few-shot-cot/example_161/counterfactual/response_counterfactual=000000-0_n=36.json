{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a \u201cheavy feeling\u201d in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely physical exam finding for this patient, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n- She has heavy and irregular periods, intermenstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a \"heavy feeling\" in her pelvis, and increased urinary frequency.\n- These symptoms are commonly associated with uterine pathology.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. **Globular 10-week sized uterus**\n   - This describes a uniform enlargement of the uterus, which is often seen in conditions like adenomyosis.\n\nB. **Adnexal mass**\n   - This suggests an ovarian or fallopian tube mass, but the symptoms described are more consistent with uterine rather than adnexal pathology.\n\nC. **Irregular 14-week sized uterus**\n   - This describes an enlarged uterus with irregular contours, commonly seen in uterine fibroids (leiomyomas).\n\nD. **No remarkable physical exam finding**\n   - This is unlikely given the significant symptomatology.\n\nConsidering the symptoms and their common etiologies:\n\n- **Heavy menstrual bleeding and irregular cycles** are often seen with uterine fibroids.\n- **Dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia** can also be associated with fibroids due to pressure effects.\n- The \"heavy feeling\" in the pelvis and increased urinary frequency are suggestive of a mass effect from an enlarged uterus.\n\nGiven these factors, the most consistent finding would be an **irregularly enlarged uterus** consistent with fibroids.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
