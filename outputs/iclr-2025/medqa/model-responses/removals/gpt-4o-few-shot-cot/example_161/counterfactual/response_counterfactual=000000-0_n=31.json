{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely physical exam finding in this patient, let's analyze her symptoms and clinical presentation:\n\n- **Heavy menstrual bleeding**: Soaking a super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days indicates menorrhagia.\n- **Irregular cycles with intermenstrual bleeding**: This suggests an abnormal uterine pathology.\n- **Dysmenorrhea**: Significant menstrual pain requiring frequent ibuprofen.\n- **Dyspareunia**: Pain during intercourse.\n- **Pelvic heaviness**: A sensation of a heavy pelvis suggests an enlarged or abnormal uterus.\n- **Increased urinary frequency**: This can be due to pressure on the bladder by an enlarged uterus.\n\nGiven these symptoms, the most likely differential is uterine fibroids (leiomyomas), which are benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus. They can cause heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, and pressure symptoms on the bladder and bowel.\n\nAmong the physical exam findings:\n- **A globular 10-week sized uterus**: This suggests an enlarged uterus, potentially due to adenomyosis.\n- **An adnexal mass**: This is less likely given the symptoms described.\n- **An irregular 14-week sized uterus**: This fits well with the description of symptoms and the likely presence of uterine fibroids.\n- **No remarkable physical exam finding**: This would be unlikely given the significant symptoms described.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most likely physical exam finding in this patient is:\n\nAnswer: C. Irregular 14-week sized uterus", "answer": "C"}
