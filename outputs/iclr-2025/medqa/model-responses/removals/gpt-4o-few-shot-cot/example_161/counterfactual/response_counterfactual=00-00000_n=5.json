{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 45-year-old G5P4105 presents to her gynecologist\u2019s office. She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a \u201cheavy feeling\u201d in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely physical exam finding in this patient, let's consider the clinical presentation:\n\n1. **Heavy Menstrual Bleeding and Irregular Cycles**: The patient reports soaking a super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle and has intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. This suggests a significant change in menstrual patterns.\n\n2. **Dysmenorrhea**: She requires 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for pain relief during menses. This level of pain management indicates severe menstrual cramps.\n\n3. **Dyspareunia and Pelvic Pressure**: New onset mild dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) and a \"heavy feeling\" in her pelvis suggest the presence of a pelvic mass or structural abnormality.\n\n4. **Increased Urinary Frequency**: This symptom is often associated with a mass effect in the pelvis, potentially pressing on the bladder.\n\n5. **Obesity and Type II Diabetes**: These conditions do not directly indicate the underlying cause of her symptoms but are relevant for a complete medical profile.\n\nGiven these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is uterine fibroids (leiomyomas). Uterine fibroids are common in women of reproductive age and can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular cycles, significant dysmenorrhea, pelvic pressure, and urinary frequency due to the size and location of the fibroids.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the physical exam findings:\n\n- **A. Globular 10-week sized uterus**: A uniformly enlarged uterus is typically associated with adenomyosis rather than fibroids.\n- **B. Adnexal mass**: This would suggest ovarian pathology, which is less likely given the symptoms.\n- **C. Irregular 14-week sized uterus**: Uterine fibroids often cause an irregularly enlarged uterus, consistent with the patient's symptoms of heavy bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and pelvic discomfort.\n- **D. No remarkable physical exam finding**: This is unlikely given the significant symptoms and clinical picture presented.\n\nThus, the most likely physical exam finding in this patient is an **irregularly enlarged uterus**, characteristic of uterine fibroids.\n\n**Answer: C**", "answer": "C"}
