Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the symptoms and details provided in the case:\n\n### Key Symptoms and Details:\n- **Increasingly heavy periods** for six months\n- **Soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours** for five days each cycle\n- **Irregular cycles** with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months\n- **Significant dysmenorrhea** requiring ibuprofen\n- **New onset mild dyspareunia** (painful intercourse)\n- **\"Heavy feeling\" in her pelvis**\n- **Increased urinary frequency**\n- History of five spontaneous vaginal deliveries\n\n### Examination Findings:\n- Temperature: 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C)\n- Blood pressure: 137/84 mmHg\n- Pulse: 87/min\n- Respirations: 14/min\n\n### Possible Diagnoses:\nGiven these symptoms, the most likely diagnoses to consider are:\n1. **Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas):** Common in women of reproductive age, presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, and increased urinary frequency.\n2. **Adenomyosis:** Characterized by a globular, enlarged uterus with associated heavy bleeding and dysmenorrhea.\n3. **Endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy:** Can present with irregular bleeding but less likely given the mild dyspareunia and pelvic heaviness.\n\n### Physical Exam Findings:\n- **Globular 10-week sized uterus:** Typically associated with adenomyosis.\n- **Adnexal mass:** Would suggest ovarian pathology, less likely given the symptoms.\n- **Irregular 14-week sized uterus:** Suggestive of uterine fibroids.\n- **No remarkable physical exam finding:** Unlikely given the significant symptoms described.\n\nBased on the detailed symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular cycles, significant dysmenorrhea, pelvic heaviness, and increased urinary frequency, the most likely physical exam finding would be an **irregularly enlarged uterus** consistent with uterine fibroids.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most likely physical exam finding in this patient is an irregular 14-week sized uterus, which aligns with the symptoms and typical presentation of uterine fibroids.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
