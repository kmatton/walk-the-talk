Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a \u201cheavy feeling\u201d in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely physical exam finding for this patient, we need to analyze the clinical presentation and symptoms.\n\n### Clinical Presentation and Symptoms:\n1. **Heavy menstrual bleeding**: Soaking one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle.\n2. **Irregular menstrual cycles**: Intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months.\n3. **Significant dysmenorrhea**: Requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours.\n4. **New onset mild dyspareunia**: Painful intercourse.\n5. **Heavy feeling in the pelvis**: Suggests a mass or enlargement.\n6. **Increased urinary frequency**: Could be due to pressure on the bladder.\n7. **Past medical history**: Obesity and type II diabetes, which can be associated with various gynecological conditions.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis:\n- **Uterine Leiomyoma (Fibroids)**: Commonly present with heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, and dysmenorrhea. They can cause an irregularly enlarged uterus.\n- **Adenomyosis**: Often presents with heavy menstrual bleeding and a globular, uniformly enlarged uterus.\n- **Ovarian cysts or masses**: May cause adnexal masses but less likely to present with heavy menstrual bleeding as prominently as described.\n\n### Physical Exam Findings:\n- **Globular 10-week sized uterus (Adenomyosis)**: Typically presents with heavy bleeding and a uniformly enlarged uterus.\n- **Adnexal mass**: More indicative of ovarian pathology.\n- **Irregular 14-week sized uterus (Uterine Leiomyoma)**: Presents with heavy menstrual bleeding, irregularly enlarged uterus, and pelvic pressure.\n- **No remarkable physical exam finding**: Unlikely given the significant symptoms described.\n\n### Most Likely Diagnosis:\nGiven the heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular cycles, pelvic pressure, and new onset of mild dyspareunia, the most likely diagnosis is uterine leiomyoma (fibroids). This condition would result in an irregularly enlarged uterus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most likely physical exam finding for this patient is an irregular 14-week sized uterus, indicative of uterine leiomyoma (fibroids).\n\n**Answer: C**", "answer": "C"}
