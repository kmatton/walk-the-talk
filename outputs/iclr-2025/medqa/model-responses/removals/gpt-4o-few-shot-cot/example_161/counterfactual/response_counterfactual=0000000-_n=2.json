Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To answer the question regarding the 45-year-old woman with increasingly heavy and irregular periods, we need to consider her symptoms and possible conditions.\n\n### Symptoms and History:\n1. **Menorrhagia** (heavy menstrual bleeding): Soaking a super absorbent tampon every two hours.\n2. **Irregular cycles** with intermenstrual bleeding.\n3. **Dysmenorrhea**: Significant menstrual pain requiring ibuprofen.\n4. **Dyspareunia**: Mild pain during intercourse.\n5. **Pelvic heaviness**: New sensation of heaviness in the pelvis.\n6. **Increased urinary frequency**.\n7. **Obesity and type II diabetes**: Risk factors that may be relevant to her condition.\n8. **Five spontaneous vaginal deliveries**: A history that might affect her current gynecological health.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis:\nConsidering these symptoms, the most likely diagnoses include:\n- **Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas)**: These can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular periods, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pressure, and increased urinary frequency.\n- **Adenomyosis**: Often presents with heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and an enlarged, tender uterus.\n\n### Physical Exam Findings:\n- **Globular 10-week sized uterus**: Suggestive of adenomyosis, where the uterus is diffusely enlarged.\n- **Adnexal mass**: Suggestive of an ovarian pathology, which is less consistent with the patient's primary complaint of heavy and irregular periods.\n- **Irregular 14-week sized uterus**: Suggestive of uterine fibroids, which cause an irregular and enlarged uterus.\n- **No remarkable physical exam finding**: Unlikely given the symptoms described.\n\n### Analysis:\nGiven the heavy and irregular menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, pelvic heaviness, and increased urinary frequency, the most consistent physical exam finding would be an **irregularly enlarged uterus**, which is characteristic of uterine fibroids. These can grow to a size comparable to a pregnancy at 14 weeks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most likely physical exam finding in this patient is an irregular 14-week-sized uterus, indicative of uterine fibroids.\n\n**Answer: C**", "answer": "C"}
