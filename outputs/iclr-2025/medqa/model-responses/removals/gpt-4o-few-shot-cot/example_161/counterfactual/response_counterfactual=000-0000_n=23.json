At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and medical history step-by-step:\n\n1. **Heavy Periods and Dysmenorrhea**: The patient reports increasingly heavy periods for six months and significant dysmenorrhea, requiring frequent ibuprofen. This suggests an underlying gynecological issue.\n\n2. **Pelvic Symptoms**: She has a \"heavy feeling\" in her pelvis and increased urinary frequency, which could indicate a mass effect in the pelvic area.\n\n3. **New Onset Dyspareunia**: The new onset of mild pain during intercourse can also be related to pelvic pathology.\n\n4. **Past Medical History**: The patient has obesity and type II diabetes, but these conditions are less likely to directly explain the gynecological symptoms.\n\n5. **Physical Exam Clues**: \n   - **Globular 10-week sized uterus (A)**: This could indicate adenomyosis, a condition characterized by a uniformly enlarged, tender uterus.\n   - **Adnexal mass (B)**: This would suggest ovarian pathology, like a cyst or tumor, which usually wouldn't present with uniformly heavy periods.\n   - **Irregular 14-week sized uterus (C)**: This is more indicative of uterine fibroids (leiomyomas), which can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, and urinary frequency due to their size and irregular shape.\n   - **No remarkable physical exam finding (D)**: Given the patient's significant symptoms, it's unlikely that the physical exam would be unremarkable.\n\nConsidering all these points, the most likely physical exam finding in this patient, given her symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, and urinary frequency, is an **irregular 14-week sized uterus** due to uterine fibroids.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
