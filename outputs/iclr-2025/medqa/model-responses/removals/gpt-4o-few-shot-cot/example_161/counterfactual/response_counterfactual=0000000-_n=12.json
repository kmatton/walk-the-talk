No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely physical exam finding in this patient, we need to consider her symptoms and history:\n\n- **Heavy menstrual bleeding**, irregular cycles, and intermenstrual bleeding suggest a structural abnormality or a hormonal imbalance.\n- **Significant dysmenorrhea** and dyspareunia, along with a \"heavy feeling\" in the pelvis, point towards a possible pelvic pathology.\n- **Increased urinary frequency** can indicate a mass effect on the bladder.\n\nGiven these symptoms and her history of obesity and type II diabetes, the following conditions are possible:\n\n- **Fibroids (Leiomyomas)**: These can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular cycles, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pressure, and increased urinary frequency. A fibroid uterus typically presents as an irregularly enlarged uterus on physical exam.\n- **Adenomyosis**: This condition can cause a globular, symmetrically enlarged uterus and is associated with heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. **Globular 10-week sized uterus**: Indicative of adenomyosis, which fits some but not all of her symptoms.\nB. **Adnexal mass**: Typically associated with ovarian cysts or tumors, which might not account for the majority of her symptoms.\nC. **Irregular 14-week sized uterus**: This description is highly suggestive of uterine fibroids, which align with her symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular cycles, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pressure, and increased urinary frequency.\nD. **No remarkable physical exam finding**: Unlikely given her significant and persistent symptoms.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and the most likely causes, the best answer is:\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
