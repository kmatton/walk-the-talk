{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions.

She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months.

She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "The patient's symptoms of heavy and irregular periods, significant dysmenorrhea, mild dyspareunia, pelvic heaviness, and increased urinary frequency are suggestive of a structural abnormality in the uterus. Given her history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is uterine fibroids (leiomyomas).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Heavy and irregular periods**: Uterine fibroids commonly cause menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) and irregular cycles.\n- **Dysmenorrhea**: Painful periods are a typical symptom of fibroids.\n- **Dyspareunia**: Mild pain during intercourse can also be associated with fibroids.\n- **Pelvic heaviness and increased urinary frequency**: These symptoms suggest a mass effect, common with larger fibroids.\n\n### Physical Exam Findings:\n\n- **Globular 10-week sized uterus**: This finding is consistent with adenomyosis, not typically presenting with irregular bleeding or mass effect symptoms.\n- **Adnexal mass**: This finding is more suggestive of an ovarian pathology, such as a cyst or tumor, rather than fibroids.\n- **Irregular 14-week sized uterus**: This is the most likely finding. Fibroids often cause the uterus to feel irregular and enlarged on physical examination, correlating with the patient's symptoms and history.\n- **No remarkable physical exam finding**: Given the severity and nature of her symptoms, it's unlikely that her physical exam would be unremarkable.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the patient's presentation and symptoms, the most likely physical exam finding would be an irregularly enlarged uterus consistent with fibroids.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
