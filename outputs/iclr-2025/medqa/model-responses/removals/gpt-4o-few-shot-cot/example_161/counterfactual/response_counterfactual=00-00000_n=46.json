Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months.

The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this, let's analyze the symptoms and clinical presentation step-by-step.\n\n1. **Menstrual Irregularities:**\n   - The patient experiences heavy menstrual bleeding (soaks a tampon every two hours).\n   - She has intermenstrual bleeding and significant dysmenorrhea.\n\n2. **Pelvic Symptoms:**\n   - She reports a \"heavy feeling\" in her pelvis.\n   - She experiences mild dyspareunia (pain during intercourse).\n   - Increased urinary frequency is noted.\n\n3. **Relevant Medical History:**\n   - Obesity and type II diabetes.\n   - Five full-term pregnancies and five vaginal deliveries.\n\n4. **Physical Exam Findings:**\n   - Vital signs are within normal limits.\n\nGiven these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is **uterine fibroids (leiomyomas)**. Uterine fibroids can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular cycles, pelvic pressure, and urinary frequency. \n\n**Physical Exam Findings:**\n- A **globular 10-week sized uterus** is consistent with the presence of uterine fibroids, which can cause uterine enlargement and give the uterus a globular shape.\n\nLet's rule out the other options:\n- **Adnexal mass**: Suggests an ovarian issue, which doesn't align with the patient's primary symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pressure.\n- **Irregular 14-week sized uterus**: While an irregular uterus could suggest fibroids, the description of a 10-week size is more specific and fits better with the globular shape associated with fibroids.\n- **No remarkable physical exam finding**: Given the significant symptoms, it is unlikely that there would be no physical findings.\n\nTherefore, the most likely physical exam finding is:\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
