Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion.

The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms, past medical history, and likely conditions that could explain the findings.\n\n1. **Symptoms**: The patient reports heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), irregular cycles, intermenstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), mild dyspareunia (painful intercourse), pelvic heaviness, and increased urinary frequency.\n2. **Past Medical History**: She has obesity, type II diabetes, and a history of multiple childbirths (G5P4105).\n3. **Differential Diagnosis**: The symptoms suggest a gynecological condition, possibly related to the uterus. Common causes of these symptoms include uterine fibroids (leiomyomas), adenomyosis, and endometrial hyperplasia.\n\n- **Uterine Fibroids (Leiomyomas)**: These are benign tumors of the uterus that can cause heavy bleeding, irregular cycles, pelvic pain, urinary frequency, and a feeling of pelvic heaviness. They often lead to an enlarged and irregularly shaped uterus.\n- **Adenomyosis**: This condition involves the presence of endometrial tissue within the uterine muscle, leading to a uniformly enlarged (globular) uterus and heavy, painful periods.\n- **Endometrial Hyperplasia**: This condition involves the thickening of the endometrial lining and can cause irregular bleeding but usually does not cause significant uterine enlargement or a globular shape.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the common physical findings associated with these conditions, the most likely diagnosis is uterine fibroids, which would typically present with an irregularly enlarged uterus.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
