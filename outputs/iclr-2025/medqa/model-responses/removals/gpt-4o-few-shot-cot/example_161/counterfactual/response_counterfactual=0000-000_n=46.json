Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, we'll consider the patient's history, symptoms, and the physical exam findings that correlate with common gynecological conditions.\n\nThe patient is experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding (soaking a super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days) and has irregular cycles with intermenstrual bleeding. These symptoms suggest the possibility of a structural uterine abnormality. The most common cause of heavy and irregular menstrual bleeding in women of reproductive age includes uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) and endometrial hyperplasia.\n\nGiven the patient's age (45 years), history of obesity and type II diabetes, and the described symptoms, uterine fibroids are a likely consideration. Uterine fibroids often present with an enlarged, irregular uterus on physical examination.\n\n- **A. Globular 10-week sized uterus**: This description typically fits with adenomyosis, which can cause heavy menstrual bleeding but often presents with a uniformly enlarged, boggy uterus rather than an irregular one.\n- **B. Adnexal mass**: This would suggest an ovarian pathology, which does not typically present with heavy menstrual bleeding and the described symptoms.\n- **C. Irregular 14-week sized uterus**: This finding is consistent with uterine fibroids, which can cause heavy menstrual bleeding and an irregularly enlarged uterus.\n- **D. No remarkable physical exam finding**: This option is less likely given the significant symptoms described.\n\nConsidering the symptoms and the most likely gynecological condition, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
