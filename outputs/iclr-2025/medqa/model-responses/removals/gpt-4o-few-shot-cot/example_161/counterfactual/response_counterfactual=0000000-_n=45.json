Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze the patient's symptoms and medical history to determine the most likely physical exam finding.\n\n1. **Symptoms and History**:\n   - Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) with irregular cycles and intermenstrual bleeding.\n   - Significant dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation).\n   - New onset of mild dyspareunia (painful intercourse).\n   - A \"heavy feeling\" in the pelvis.\n   - Increased urinary frequency.\n   - Past medical history includes obesity and type II diabetes.\n   - Five spontaneous vaginal deliveries.\n\n2. **Evaluation of Symptoms**:\n   - The combination of heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular cycles, and pelvic pain can be indicative of uterine pathology.\n   - The \"heavy feeling\" in the pelvis and increased urinary frequency suggest a possible mass effect on the bladder.\n\n3. **Differential Diagnosis**:\n   - **Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas)**: These are common in women of reproductive age and can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and pressure symptoms on the bladder.\n   - **Adenomyosis**: This condition can also cause a globular enlargement of the uterus, heavy bleeding, and dysmenorrhea.\n   - **Endometrial hyperplasia or cancer**: Typically considered in postmenopausal women but can present with irregular bleeding.\n\n4. **Physical Exam Findings**:\n   - **Globular 10-week sized uterus**: This finding is typical of adenomyosis, where the uterus is uniformly enlarged.\n   - **Adnexal mass**: This would suggest an ovarian or tubal pathology, which is less likely given the presenting symptoms.\n   - **Irregular 14-week sized uterus**: This is suggestive of uterine fibroids, as they often cause an irregular enlargement of the uterus.\n   - **No remarkable physical exam finding**: Unlikely given the patient's significant symptoms.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of heavy bleeding, irregular cycles, pelvic pain, and pressure symptoms, the most likely physical exam finding is an irregularly enlarged uterus, which is consistent with uterine fibroids.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
