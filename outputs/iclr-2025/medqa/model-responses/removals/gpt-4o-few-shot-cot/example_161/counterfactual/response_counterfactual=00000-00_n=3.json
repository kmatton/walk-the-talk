Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a \u201cheavy feeling\u201d in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "This patient's presentation with increasingly heavy and irregular periods, intermenstrual bleeding, significant dysmenorrhea, mild dyspareunia, and a \"heavy feeling\" in her pelvis suggests a common gynecological condition. Additionally, the increased urinary frequency could be indicative of a mass effect on the bladder. Given her history of multiple vaginal deliveries and current symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is uterine fibroids (leiomyomas).\n\nUterine fibroids can cause the uterus to enlarge and become irregular in shape. This often results in a uterus that feels irregular and enlarged on physical examination. The size of the uterus is often described in terms of weeks of gestation, similar to a pregnancy.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. **Globular 10-week sized uterus**: This can be seen in conditions like adenomyosis where the uterus is uniformly enlarged.\nB. **Adnexal mass**: This could be indicative of an ovarian cyst or tumor, which doesn't completely align with the patient's heavy menstrual bleeding and uterine symptoms.\nC. **Irregular 14-week sized uterus**: This is characteristic of uterine fibroids, which cause an irregular enlargement of the uterus.\nD. **No remarkable physical exam finding**: This is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and history.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation, the most likely finding is an irregularly enlarged uterus, consistent with uterine fibroids.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
