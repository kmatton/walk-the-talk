{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: An otherwise healthy 15-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. His temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg and the pulse is 100/min. Past medical history is noncontributory and he takes no medication. His father and aunt both suffer from mild anemia. His hemoglobin is 5 g/dL and platelet count is slightly reduced. His peripheral blood smear is shown in the picture. Over the next 2 weeks, the patient recovers, and his hemoglobin is 11 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the pattern of inheritance of this patient underlying disorder?\nA. Autosomal dominant\nB. X-linked recessive\nC. X-linked dominant\nD. Multifactorial\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the pattern of inheritance for this patient's disorder, let's analyze the clinical presentation and the provided family history.\n\n### Clinical Presentation:\n- **Extreme fatigue and shortness of breath:** These are common symptoms of anemia.\n- **Temperature:** 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F) \u2013 normal.\n- **Blood Pressure:** 100/60 mm Hg \u2013 within normal limits.\n- **Pulse:** 100/min \u2013 tachycardia, often seen in anemia due to compensatory mechanisms.\n- **Hemoglobin:** 5 g/dL \u2013 significantly low indicating severe anemia.\n- **Platelet count:** Slightly reduced, but not the primary issue given the context.\n- **Peripheral blood smear:** (Note: The specific details of the smear are not provided, but it would likely show features consistent with the type of anemia).\n\n### Family History:\n- Both the father and aunt have mild anemia, suggesting a hereditary component. Given that both males and females in the family are affected, it helps narrow down the inheritance pattern.\n\n### Recovery:\n- The patient\u2019s recovery with hemoglobin rising to 11 g/dL suggests a possible episodic or stress-induced nature of the anemia.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis:\nConsidering the family history and the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a form of hereditary anemia. Common hereditary anemias include Thalassemias and Hereditary Spherocytosis, among others.\n\n**Hereditary Spherocytosis:**\n- **Inheritance Pattern:** Typically autosomal dominant.\n- Affects both males and females.\n- Commonly presents with hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly.\n- Peripheral blood smear often shows spherocytes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe combination of the clinical presentation, family history of anemia in both males and females, and the episodic nature of the anemia suggests an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. \n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
