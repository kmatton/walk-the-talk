{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: An otherwise healthy 15-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. His temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg and the pulse is 100/min. Past medical history is noncontributory and he takes no medication. His father and aunt both suffer from mild anemia. On examination, he is very pale and his spleen is enlarged. His hemoglobin is 5 g/dL and platelet count is slightly reduced. His peripheral blood smear is shown in the picture. Which of the following best represents the pattern of inheritance of this patient underlying disorder?\nA. Autosomal dominant\nB. X-linked recessive\nC. X-linked dominant\nD. Multifactorial\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "First, let's analyze the given question and the patient's symptoms:\n\n1. **Patient Information**: The patient is a 15-year-old boy presenting with extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, pallor, and an enlarged spleen. His hemoglobin level is critically low (5 g/dL) and his platelet count is slightly reduced.\n\n2. **Family History**: Both his father and aunt have mild anemia, suggesting a hereditary component.\n\n3. **Blood Smear**: Although the image is not provided, based on the clinical context and familial history, conditions like hereditary spherocytosis or other hemolytic anemias should be considered.\n\nGiven the family history and the presentation, hereditary spherocytosis is a likely diagnosis. Hereditary spherocytosis is a condition characterized by the presence of spherocytes (abnormally shaped red blood cells) in the blood, which leads to hemolytic anemia. This condition is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n### Reasoning for Each Option:\n- **A. Autosomal dominant**: Hereditary spherocytosis is often inherited in this manner. Given the family history of anemia in close relatives (father and aunt), an autosomal dominant inheritance is consistent with the pattern observed in this disorder.\n- **B. X-linked recessive**: This pattern would typically affect males more severely and females might be carriers. It\u2019s less consistent with the family history provided.\n- **C. X-linked dominant**: This pattern would likely show a different family history, affecting both males and females, but with different severity and transmission patterns.\n- **D. Multifactorial**: This pattern involves multiple genetic and environmental factors and is less likely given the clear hereditary pattern indicated by the family history.\n\nGiven the information and the common inheritance pattern of hereditary spherocytosis:\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
