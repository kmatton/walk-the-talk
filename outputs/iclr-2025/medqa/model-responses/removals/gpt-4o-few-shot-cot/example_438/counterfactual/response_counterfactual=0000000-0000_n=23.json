{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: An otherwise healthy 15-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. His temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg and the pulse is 100/min. Past medical history is noncontributory and he takes no medication. His father and aunt both suffer from mild anemia. His hemoglobin is 5 g/dL and platelet count is slightly reduced. His peripheral blood smear is shown in the picture. Over the next 2 weeks, the patient recovers, and his hemoglobin is 11 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the pattern of inheritance of this patient underlying disorder?\nA. Autosomal dominant\nB. X-linked recessive\nC. X-linked dominant\nD. Multifactorial\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the pattern of inheritance for this patient's condition, we need to consider the clinical and family history, as well as the lab findings.\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient, a 15-year-old boy, presents with extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, and severe anemia (hemoglobin of 5 g/dL) which resolves over the next 2 weeks to a hemoglobin of 11 g/dL. The fact that he recovers suggests a transient condition.\n\n2. **Family History**: The patient's father and aunt have mild anemia, suggesting a hereditary component. Since both a male (father) and a female (aunt) are affected, an X-linked recessive pattern is less likely, as these typically affect males more severely and would require a mother to be a carrier.\n\n3. **Peripheral Blood Smear**: Although the smear image is not provided here, we might expect findings consistent with a hemolytic anemia such as spherocytes, bite cells, or other abnormal red blood cell morphologies if a hereditary condition like hereditary spherocytosis or G6PD deficiency is suspected.\n\n4. **Inheritance Pattern**:\n   - **Autosomal Dominant**: Conditions like hereditary spherocytosis often follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, manifesting in both males and females with each generation.\n   - **X-linked Recessive**: This pattern is less likely given the information about both male and female relatives affected.\n   - **X-linked Dominant**: This is rare and would likely show a very different pattern with affected mothers passing the condition to all children.\n   - **Multifactorial**: This is generally used for conditions that result from multiple genetic and environmental factors, which seems less likely in this context given the clear familial pattern.\n\nGiven the family history and the likelihood of a hereditary anemia, the pattern of inheritance is most consistent with an autosomal dominant disorder.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
