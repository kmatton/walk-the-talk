{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Osteosarcoma\nB. Osteochondroma\nC. Ewing sarcoma\nD. Osteoid osteoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for the boy with progressive left leg pain, let's analyze the key elements of the case:\n\n1. **Duration and Nature of Pain**: Progressive pain over 2 months that interferes with sleep.\n2. **Initial Trauma**: History of being hit by a baseball, causing initial redness and swelling.\n3. **Physical Examination**: Marked tenderness along the left mid-femur.\n4. **Laboratory Findings**: Elevated leukocyte count (21,000/mm3) and elevated ESR (68 mm/h).\n5. **Imaging**: X-ray shows multiple lytic lesions and new bone formation (onion-skin appearance).\n6. **Biopsy**: Shows small round blue cells.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Osteosarcoma**: Typically presents with localized pain and swelling. X-ray often shows a mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion with a \"sunburst\" pattern. It is more common in the metaphysis of long bones. The biopsy usually shows malignant osteoid.\n\nB. **Osteochondroma**: A benign bone tumor that typically presents as a painless, palpable mass near a joint. It is characterized by a bony outgrowth covered by a cartilage cap. It doesn\u2019t match the severe pain or biopsy findings described.\n\nC. **Ewing Sarcoma**: This is a highly malignant tumor that often presents with pain and systemic symptoms such as fever. It commonly affects the diaphysis of long bones. The X-ray findings of lytic lesions with periosteal reaction (onion-skin appearance) and biopsy findings of small round blue cells are classic for Ewing sarcoma.\n\nD. **Osteoid Osteoma**: Typically presents with nocturnal pain relieved by NSAIDs. X-ray usually shows a small, radiolucent nidus. It doesn\u2019t match the extensive lytic lesions or biopsy findings described.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation, imaging, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Answer: C. Ewing sarcoma**\n\n### Explanation:\nEwing sarcoma is characterized by:\n- Progressive bone pain often worsened at night.\n- Elevated inflammatory markers (leukocyte count and ESR).\n- X-ray showing lytic lesions with periosteal reaction (onion-skin appearance).\n- Biopsy revealing small round blue cells.\n\nThese features align closely with the patient's presentation and diagnostic findings.", "answer": "C"}
