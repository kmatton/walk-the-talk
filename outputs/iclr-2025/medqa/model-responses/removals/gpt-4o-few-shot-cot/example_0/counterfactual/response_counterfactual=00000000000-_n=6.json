{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Osteosarcoma\nB. Osteochondroma\nC. Ewing sarcoma\nD. Osteoid osteoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "Sure, let's break down the details and solve this step-by-step.\n\n**Patient Presentation:**\n- Progressive left leg pain for 2 months.\n- Pain interferes with sleep.\n- Ibuprofen not improving symptoms.\n- History of trauma (hit by a baseball).\n- Marked tenderness along the left mid-femur.\n- Normal gait.\n- Leukocyte count: 21,000/mm\u00b3 (elevated).\n- ESR: 68 mm/h (elevated).\n- X-ray: multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, surrounding cortex covered by several layers of new bone.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Osteosarcoma**:\n   - Typically presents with localized bone pain and swelling.\n   - Often found in the metaphyseal region of long bones (e.g., distal femur, proximal tibia).\n   - Radiographically, it shows a \"sunburst\" pattern and Codman's triangle.\n   - The x-ray findings and elevated leukocyte count/ESR are consistent, but the \"multiple lytic lesions\" are more suggestive of another diagnosis.\n\n2. **Osteochondroma**:\n   - Usually asymptomatic and presents as a painless mass.\n   - It's a benign bone tumor often found in the metaphyseal region.\n   - X-ray typically shows a bony outgrowth with a cartilage cap.\n   - The description of multiple lytic lesions in the femur does not fit this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Ewing Sarcoma**:\n   - Common in children and adolescents.\n   - Presents with pain and swelling, often worsening at night.\n   - Frequently found in the diaphysis (shaft) of long bones.\n   - Radiographically, shows \"onion skin\" periosteal reaction (layered appearance).\n   - Elevated leukocyte count and ESR are consistent with this diagnosis.\n   - The x-ray findings of multiple lytic lesions and new bone formation (onion skin) fit this diagnosis well.\n\n4. **Osteoid Osteoma**:\n   - Usually presents with localized pain, often worse at night, relieved by NSAIDs.\n   - Commonly affects the cortex of long bones.\n   - Radiographically shows a small, round lucency (nidus) surrounded by sclerotic bone.\n   - The x-ray findings and the lack of significant relief from NSAIDs do not fit this diagnosis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe x-ray findings of multiple lytic lesions with layers of new bone formation (\"onion skin\" appearance), along with the patient's symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers, are most suggestive of **Ewing Sarcoma**.\n\n**Answer: C. Ewing sarcoma**", "answer": "C"}
