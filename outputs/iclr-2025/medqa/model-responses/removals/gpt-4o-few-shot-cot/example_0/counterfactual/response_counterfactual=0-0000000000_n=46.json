{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 13-year-old is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with sleep. The patient's mother has been giving ibuprofen at night for \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d but the symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused the leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. The gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Osteosarcoma\nB. Osteochondroma\nC. Ewing sarcoma\nD. Osteoid osteoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis, we need to analyze the patient's presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results.\n\n1. **Patient Presentation**:\n   - Progressive left leg pain for 2 months\n   - Pain interfering with sleep, not improved by ibuprofen\n   - History of trauma (hit by a baseball causing redness and swelling)\n\n2. **Physical & Laboratory Findings**:\n   - Marked tenderness along the left mid-femur\n   - Leukocytosis (21,000/mm\u00b3)\n   - Elevated ESR (68 mm/h)\n\n3. **Imaging Findings**:\n   - X-ray shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur\n   - Surrounding cortex covered by several layers of new bone (indicative of periosteal reaction)\n\n4. **Biopsy Findings**:\n   - Small round blue cells\n\nNow, let\u2019s match these findings with the potential diagnoses:\n\nA. **Osteosarcoma**:\n   - Typically presents with a sunburst pattern of bone formation on imaging\n   - Histology shows malignant osteoid production\n   - Generally affects the metaphysis of long bones\n   - Not typically characterized by small round blue cells\n\nB. **Osteochondroma**:\n   - Benign bone growth, usually asymptomatic unless it impinges on surrounding structures\n   - Does not present with lytic lesions or small round blue cells\n   - Typically presents as a bony outgrowth, not as multiple lytic lesions\n\nC. **Ewing Sarcoma**:\n   - Common in children and adolescents\n   - Typically presents with localized pain and swelling, often following minor trauma\n   - Imaging shows lytic lesions with periosteal reaction (onion skin appearance)\n   - Biopsy reveals small round blue cells\n   - Elevated leukocyte count and ESR are common\n\nD. **Osteoid Osteoma**:\n   - Typically presents with nocturnal pain relieved by NSAIDs\n   - Imaging shows a small, round, radiolucent nidus\n   - Not associated with multiple lytic lesions or small round blue cells\n   - Not typically accompanied by significant leukocytosis or elevated ESR\n\nBased on the patient\u2019s age, symptoms, imaging findings, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Answer: C. Ewing sarcoma**", "answer": "C"}
