{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d but his symptoms have not improved. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Osteosarcoma\nB. Osteochondroma\nC. Ewing sarcoma\nD. Osteoid osteoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "To solve this, we'll consider the key clinical findings and the results of the diagnostic tests:\n\n1. **Patient's Age and Symptoms**: The patient is a 13-year-old boy with progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which is severe enough to interfere with sleep. This age group and symptom pattern are suggestive of a bone tumor.\n\n2. **Laboratory Findings**: Elevated leukocyte count (21,000/mm\u00b3) and elevated ESR (68 mm/h) indicate an inflammatory or malignant process.\n\n3. **X-ray Findings**: The x-ray shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur with \"onion-skin\" periosteal reaction (several layers of new bone). This finding is characteristic of a malignancy, specifically one with aggressive bone destruction and periosteal reaction.\n\n4. **Biopsy Findings**: The biopsy reveals small round blue cells, which is a classic description for Ewing sarcoma.\n\nLet's consider each option based on the findings:\n\n- **A. Osteosarcoma**: Typically presents as a mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion with a \"sunburst\" pattern of periosteal reaction. It often occurs in the metaphysis of long bones. While common in teenagers, the described x-ray and biopsy findings do not match osteosarcoma.\n\n- **B. Osteochondroma**: This is a benign bone tumor that usually presents as a painless mass near the joints, especially around the knee. It does not fit the aggressive nature of the symptoms, x-ray, or biopsy findings.\n\n- **C. Ewing sarcoma**: Most commonly occurs in children and adolescents, typically presenting with pain and sometimes systemic symptoms like fever. The x-ray findings of lytic lesions with \"onion-skin\" periosteal reaction and biopsy showing small round blue cells are classic for Ewing sarcoma.\n\n- **D. Osteoid osteoma**: This benign tumor typically presents with night pain relieved by NSAIDs and a small, well-demarcated, radiolucent nidus on x-ray. The described x-ray and biopsy findings are not consistent with osteoid osteoma.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation, lab results, x-ray, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n**C. Ewing sarcoma**", "answer": "C"}
