{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Osteosarcoma\nB. Osteochondroma\nC. Ewing sarcoma\nD. Osteoid osteoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for this 13-year-old boy with progressive left leg pain, it's important to consider the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and biopsy results.\n\n1. **Progressive leg pain interfering with sleep**: This indicates a significant underlying issue rather than just a minor injury or growing pains.\n2. **Tenderness along the mid-femur**: This localized tenderness suggests the pain originates from the bone.\n3. **Leukocyte count of 21,000/mm\u00b3 and ESR of 68 mm/h**: These elevated values suggest an inflammatory or neoplastic process.\n4. **Biopsy showing small round blue cells**: This histopathological finding is a key detail.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Osteosarcoma**: This typically presents with bone pain and swelling, and it is common in adolescents. However, osteosarcoma usually shows malignant osteoid production on biopsy, not small round blue cells.\n\nB. **Osteochondroma**: This is usually a benign bone growth that is often asymptomatic unless it causes mechanical issues or fractures. It would not account for the elevated leukocyte count, ESR, or the biopsy findings.\n\nC. **Ewing sarcoma**: This is a malignant bone tumor that often presents in children and adolescents. It is characterized by progressive pain, tenderness, and systemic symptoms, and typically shows small round blue cells on biopsy. The elevated leukocyte count and ESR are consistent with its inflammatory nature.\n\nD. **Osteoid osteoma**: This benign bone tumor typically causes pain that is worse at night and relieved by NSAIDs. It does not usually cause significant systemic symptoms or elevated inflammatory markers, and the biopsy would show a nidus of osteoid tissue surrounded by reactive bone formation, not small round blue cells.\n\nGiven the presentation and biopsy findings, **Ewing sarcoma** is the most likely diagnosis.\n\n**Answer: C. Ewing sarcoma**", "answer": "C"}
