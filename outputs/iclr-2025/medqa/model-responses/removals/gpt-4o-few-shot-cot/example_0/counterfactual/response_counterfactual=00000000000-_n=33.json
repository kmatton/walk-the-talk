{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Osteosarcoma\nB. Osteochondroma\nC. Ewing sarcoma\nD. Osteoid osteoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 13-year-old boy with progressive left leg pain, we should evaluate the symptoms and findings systematically. \n\n**Key points to consider:**\n\n1. **Duration and Nature of Pain:** The pain has been progressive for 2 months and interferes with sleep, which is a sign of a serious underlying condition.\n2. **Response to NSAIDs:** The symptoms have not improved with ibuprofen, suggesting the pain is not due to a simple inflammatory or benign cause.\n3. **Previous Trauma:** Pain onset followed a minor trauma, but it has persisted and worsened, suggesting the trauma might have been coincidental.\n4. **Laboratory Findings:** Elevated leukocyte count (21,000/mm\u00b3) and ESR (68 mm/h) indicate an inflammatory or malignant process.\n5. **X-ray Findings:** The presence of multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, with new bone formation in a layered manner, suggests a malignant bone tumor.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis:**\n\nA. **Osteosarcoma:** Typically presents with localized pain and swelling, often around the knee, and has mixed lytic and sclerotic lesions on x-ray. It often shows a \"sunburst\" pattern due to new bone formation.\n\nB. **Osteochondroma:** A benign bone tumor that usually presents as a painless mass and does not typically cause progressive pain or have the described x-ray findings.\n\nC. **Ewing Sarcoma:** This typically presents in children and adolescents with localized pain, often with systemic symptoms, and has characteristic x-ray findings of lytic lesions with layered periosteal reaction (\"onion skin\" appearance).\n\nD. **Osteoid Osteoma:** Usually presents with night pain that is relieved by NSAIDs, and typically shows a small, round, radiolucent nidus on imaging.\n\n**Considering the details:**\n\n- The progressive pain not relieved by NSAIDs, elevated inflammatory markers (leukocyte count and ESR), and characteristic \"onion skin\" periosteal reaction on x-ray strongly suggest a diagnosis of **Ewing Sarcoma**.\n\n**Answer: C. Ewing sarcoma**\n\n### **Final Explanation:**\nThe 13-year-old boy's clinical presentation and imaging findings are most consistent with Ewing sarcoma, a malignant bone tumor common in children and adolescents. The characteristic lytic lesions with periosteal layering (\"onion skin\" appearance) on x-ray, combined with the progressive pain and elevated inflammatory markers, support this diagnosis.", "answer": "C"}
