{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Osteosarcoma\nB. Osteochondroma\nC. Ewing sarcoma\nD. Osteoid osteoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 13-year-old boy with progressive left leg pain and the given clinical presentation, we need to analyze the key features provided.\n\n1. **Progressive left leg pain for 2 months:**\n   - Suggests a chronic condition.\n\n2. **Interfering with sleep and not relieved by ibuprofen:**\n   - Indicates significant pain that is persistent.\n\n3. **Recent trauma (hit by a baseball) followed by redness and swelling:**\n   - Although there was trauma, the persistent pain and swelling suggest an underlying pathology rather than just a simple injury.\n\n4. **Marked tenderness along the left mid-femur:**\n   - Localized pain suggesting a specific area of involvement.\n\n5. **Laboratory studies:**\n   - Leukocyte count of 21,000/mm\u00b3 (elevated, indicating possible infection or inflammation).\n   - ESR of 68 mm/h (elevated, indicating inflammation or malignancy).\n\n6. **X-ray findings:**\n   - Multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur.\n   - Surrounding cortex covered by several layers of new bone (periosteal reaction).\n\nNow, let's review each option in light of these findings:\n\nA. **Osteosarcoma:**\n   - Typically presents as a painful, progressively enlarging mass.\n   - Commonly occurs in the metaphysis of long bones (e.g., distal femur, proximal tibia).\n   - Radiographic features: Mixed lytic and blastic lesions, \"sunburst\" pattern of periosteal reaction.\n   - The presentation is consistent with the patient's symptoms and x-ray findings.\n\nB. **Osteochondroma:**\n   - Usually presents as a painless, palpable mass.\n   - It is a benign bone growth often occurring near the growth plate.\n   - Radiographic features: Bony protrusion with a cartilage cap.\n   - This does not fit the description of multiple lytic lesions and significant pain.\n\nC. **Ewing sarcoma:**\n   - Typically presents with localized pain and swelling.\n   - Commonly occurs in the diaphysis of long bones (e.g., femur).\n   - Radiographic features: \"Onion skin\" periosteal reaction, lytic lesions.\n   - The presentation of multiple lytic lesions and periosteal reaction is consistent with Ewing sarcoma.\n\nD. **Osteoid osteoma:**\n   - Typically presents with localized pain that is worse at night and relieved by NSAIDs.\n   - Commonly occurs in the cortex of long bones.\n   - Radiographic features: Small, round lucent nidus surrounded by reactive bone.\n   - The pain not relieved by ibuprofen and the extensive periosteal reaction do not fit osteoid osteoma.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and radiographic findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**C. Ewing sarcoma**\n\nEwing sarcoma is consistent with the patient's symptoms of progressive pain, significant tenderness, elevated inflammatory markers, and the radiographic findings of multiple lytic lesions with periosteal reaction.", "answer": "C"}
