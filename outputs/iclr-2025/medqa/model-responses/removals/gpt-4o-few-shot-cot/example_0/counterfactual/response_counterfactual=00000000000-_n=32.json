{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Osteosarcoma\nB. Osteochondroma\nC. Ewing sarcoma\nD. Osteoid osteoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for this 13-year-old boy presenting with progressive left leg pain, we need to consider the clinical presentation and the imaging findings described. \n\nKey points from the case:\n\n1. **Progressive pain** that interferes with sleep.\n2. **Tenderness along the mid-femur**.\n3. **Elevated leukocyte count (21,000/mm\u00b3)** and **elevated ESR (68 mm/h)** suggesting an inflammatory or malignant process.\n4. **X-ray findings**: multiple lytic lesions in the femur and surrounding cortex covered by several layers of new bone.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Osteosarcoma**: This is a primary malignant bone tumor often seen in adolescents, commonly affecting the metaphyses of long bones. It typically presents with localized pain and swelling. Radiographically, it shows a mixed lytic and sclerotic pattern with periosteal reaction (e.g., \"sunburst\" pattern) and Codman's triangle. However, the multiple lytic lesions are less characteristic of osteosarcoma.\n\nB. **Osteochondroma**: This is a benign bone tumor that usually presents as a painless, palpable mass near the ends of long bones. They appear as a bony projection on imaging and are unlikely to present with progressive pain and elevated inflammatory markers.\n\nC. **Ewing sarcoma**: This is a highly malignant bone tumor that typically affects children and adolescents. It commonly presents with pain and swelling, and systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss can occur. The radiographic findings of \"onion-skin\" periosteal reaction (layers of new bone formation) are characteristic of Ewing sarcoma, which aligns with the description of the surrounding cortex covered by several layers of new bone in this case.\n\nD. **Osteoid osteoma**: This is a benign bone tumor that typically presents with nocturnal pain relieved by NSAIDs. Radiographically, it shows a small, round, radiolucent nidus surrounded by reactive sclerosis. The multiple lytic lesions and elevated inflammatory markers are not characteristic of osteoid osteoma.\n\nBased on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, **Ewing sarcoma (C)** is the most likely diagnosis.\n\n**Answer: C. Ewing sarcoma**", "answer": "C"}
