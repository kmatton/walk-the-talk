{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Osteosarcoma\nB. Osteochondroma\nC. Ewing sarcoma\nD. Osteoid osteoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "To determine the most likely diagnosis for this 13-year-old boy with progressive left leg pain, we need to consider several key clinical and diagnostic features:\n\n1. **Progressive Pain and Tenderness:** The patient has had worsening pain for 2 months, which is severe enough to interfere with sleep.\n2. **History of Trauma:** Although there was a history of trauma (being hit by a baseball), the persistent and progressive nature of the pain suggests an underlying pathology.\n3. **Laboratory Findings:** Elevated leukocyte count (21,000/mm\u00b3) and elevated ESR (68 mm/h) indicate an inflammatory or infectious process.\n4. **X-ray Findings:** The presence of multiple lytic lesions and several layers of new bone formation (often described as \"onion skin\" layering) is highly suggestive of a specific type of bone tumor.\n5. **Biopsy Findings:** The presence of small round blue cells on biopsy is a critical diagnostic clue.\n\nNow, let's review each option:\n\nA. **Osteosarcoma:** Typically presents with a sunburst pattern or Codman triangle on x-ray. It usually occurs in the metaphyseal region of long bones. The biopsy typically shows malignant osteoid production, not small round blue cells.\n\nB. **Osteochondroma:** This is a benign bone tumor that usually presents as a painless mass. X-rays typically show a bony outgrowth capped by cartilage, not lytic lesions or reactive new bone formation.\n\nC. **Ewing Sarcoma:** Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that often presents in children and adolescents. It is characterized by:\n   - Pain and swelling at the tumor site.\n   - Systemic symptoms like fever and elevated inflammatory markers.\n   - X-ray findings of lytic lesions with periosteal reaction (onion skinning).\n   - Biopsy showing small round blue cells.\n   \nD. **Osteoid Osteoma:** This benign bone tumor typically presents with nocturnal pain relieved by NSAIDs and a characteristic radiographic appearance of a small radiolucent nidus, not large lytic lesions and new bone formation.\n\nConsidering the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, x-ray characteristics, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Answer: C. Ewing sarcoma**", "answer": "C"}
