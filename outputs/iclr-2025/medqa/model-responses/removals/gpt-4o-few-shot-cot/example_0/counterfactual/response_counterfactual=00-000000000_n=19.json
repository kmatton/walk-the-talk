{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Osteosarcoma\nB. Osteochondroma\nC. Ewing sarcoma\nD. Osteoid osteoma\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed.", "response": "To determine the correct diagnosis for the 13-year-old boy with progressive left leg pain, we need to consider the clinical presentation and the findings from the laboratory studies and imaging. Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Progressive leg pain interfering with sleep**: This suggests a serious underlying condition rather than benign \"growing pains.\"\n\n2. **Tenderness along the mid-femur**: Localized tenderness can indicate a lesion or a significant pathological process in the bone.\n\n3. **Leukocyte count of 21,000/mm\u00b3 and ESR of 68 mm/h**: These elevated values indicate an inflammatory or neoplastic process.\n\n4. **X-ray findings showing multiple lytic lesions with surrounding cortex covered by several layers of new bone**: This is characteristic of a particular type of bone tumor.\n\n5. **Biopsy showing small round blue cells**: This histopathological finding is crucial in identifying the type of tumor.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Osteosarcoma**: Typically presents with a combination of bone pain and swelling, often around the knee. X-rays usually show a mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion with a \"sunburst\" pattern and Codman's triangle. It does not typically present with small round blue cells on biopsy.\n\nB. **Osteochondroma**: A benign bone tumor that usually presents as a painless mass. It would not cause elevated leukocyte counts or ESR, and it does not present with multiple lytic lesions or small round blue cells on biopsy.\n\nC. **Ewing sarcoma**: This is a malignant bone tumor that commonly presents in adolescents with pain and swelling. It often affects the mid-diaphysis of long bones like the femur. X-rays may show lytic lesions with \"onion skin\" periosteal reaction (layers of new bone). The biopsy typically shows small round blue cells.\n\nD. **Osteoid osteoma**: A benign bone lesion that typically causes night pain relieved by NSAIDs. It presents with a small, well-defined, radiolucent nidus surrounded by sclerotic bone. It does not fit the description of multiple lytic lesions or elevated inflammatory markers.\n\nBased on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Answer: C. Ewing sarcoma**\n\nEwing sarcoma is characterized by lytic lesions, periosteal reaction (onion skinning), and the presence of small round blue cells on biopsy, which fits the description given in the question.", "answer": "C"}
