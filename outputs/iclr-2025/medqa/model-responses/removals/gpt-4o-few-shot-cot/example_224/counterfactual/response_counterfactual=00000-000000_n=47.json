{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The swelling started several weeks ago but is not always present. Physical examination shows a mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?\nA. Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis\nB. Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate\nC. Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal\nD. Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cause of the mass in this patient, let's analyze the provided clues:\n\n1. **Painless right-sided scrotal swelling**: The absence of pain suggests a non-inflammatory cause.\n2. **Intermittent swelling**: The fact that the swelling is not always present may suggest a fluid-filled structure that changes in size.\n3. **Transillumination of the mass**: This strongly suggests a fluid-filled mass (such as a hydrocele), as solid masses like tumors or hernias generally do not transilluminate.\n4. **Does not increase in size on coughing**: This indicates that it is unlikely to be a hernia because hernias typically increase in size with increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing).\n5. **Palpation of normal tissue above the mass**: This suggests that the mass is confined to the scrotum and does not extend into the inguinal canal.\n6. **No bowel sounds in the mass and does not reduce in supine position**: This further rules out a hernia, as hernias often contain bowel and can reduce when lying down.\n7. **No abnormalities in the testis**: This suggests that the issue is likely related to the scrotal sac or surrounding structures.\n\nGiven these points, the most likely cause of the mass is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, leading to a hydrocele. This fits all the described characteristics including intermittent swelling, transillumination, and lack of relation to intra-abdominal pressure changes.\n\n**Incorrect options:**\n- **B. Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate**: This typically causes a congenital hydrocele or inguinal hernia, which usually presents in childhood.\n- **C. Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal**: This describes an inguinal hernia, which would not transilluminate and would change with intra-abdominal pressure.\n- **D. Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus**: This describes a varicocele, which does not transilluminate and typically presents as a \"bag of worms\" feeling.\n\n**Answer: A**", "answer": "A"}
