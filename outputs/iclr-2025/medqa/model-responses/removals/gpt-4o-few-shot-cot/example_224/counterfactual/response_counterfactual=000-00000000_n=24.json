{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The swelling is not always present. Physical examination shows an 8-cm, soft, cystic nontender right-sided scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?\nA. Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis\nB. Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate\nC. Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal\nD. Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, let's analyze the clinical presentation and physical examination findings.\n\n1. **Painless right-sided scrotal swelling**: This description is crucial. Painful swellings might indicate conditions like epididymitis or testicular torsion, which we can rule out here.\n   \n2. **Swelling is not always present**: This detail suggests that the swelling might vary with the position or activity of the patient.\n\n3. **Soft, cystic, nontender mass that transilluminates**: Transillumination is a classic sign of fluid-filled cystic structures, such as hydroceles. Solid masses, such as tumors or hernias containing bowel, do not transilluminate.\n\n4. **Mass does not increase in size on coughing**: This finding helps rule out an inguinal hernia, which typically increases in size on coughing due to increased intra-abdominal pressure.\n\n5. **Possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass**: This is another sign that the mass is likely confined to the scrotum and not extending into the inguinal canal, making an inguinal hernia less likely.\n\n6. **No bowel sounds in the mass**: Bowel sounds within a scrotal mass would be indicative of an inguinal hernia with bowel content, which is not present here.\n\n7. **Does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position**: This further supports that it is not an inguinal hernia, which might reduce when lying down.\n\n8. **Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities**: This suggests the testes themselves are not involved in the pathology.\n\nGiven these findings, the most likely cause of this mass is a hydrocele. A hydrocele is a collection of fluid within the tunica vaginalis around the testicle. This fluid imbalance can be due to a variety of reasons, including the imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis.\n\nOther options:\n- **Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate**: This would more likely present in younger patients or infants and would be associated with a congenital hydrocele or hernia.\n- **Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal**: This describes an inguinal hernia, which is less likely given the absence of bowel sounds, lack of increase in size on coughing, and the ability to palpate above the mass.\n- **Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus**: This describes a varicocele, which typically does not transilluminate and often feels like a \"bag of worms\" on palpation.\n\nThus, the most likely cause of the mass is:\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
