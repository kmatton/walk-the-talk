{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The swelling started several weeks ago but is not always present. Physical examination shows an 8-cm, soft, cystic nontender right-sided scrotal mass that transilluminates. It is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?\nA. Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis\nB. Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate\nC. Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal\nD. Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient's scrotal mass, let's analyze the key features of the presentation and match them with the potential diagnoses.\n\n1. **Painless right-sided scrotal swelling**:\n   - The swelling is described as painless and has been present for several weeks.\n   \n2. **Physical examination**:\n   - The mass is soft, cystic, and nontender.\n   - The mass transilluminates (light passes through it), suggesting it is fluid-filled.\n   - Normal scrotal tissue can be palpated above the mass.\n   - There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is supine.\n\nGiven these characteristics:\n- **Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis** (Answer A): This describes a hydrocele, which is a collection of fluid within the tunica vaginalis around the testicle. A hydrocele typically presents as a painless, cystic, transilluminating mass in the scrotum, matching the patient's symptoms and examination findings.\n\n- **Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate** (Answer B): This condition typically leads to a congenital hydrocele or an inguinal hernia. Congenital hydroceles are more common in infants and young children, and the presentation would be similar to a hydrocele. However, the patient's age and lack of mention of a congenital origin make this less likely.\n\n- **Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal** (Answer C): This describes an inguinal hernia, which may present with a scrotal mass. However, hernias do not typically transilluminate, and they often reduce when the patient is supine. This option is less consistent with the findings.\n\n- **Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus** (Answer D): This describes a varicocele, which presents as a \"bag of worms\" sensation in the scrotum and typically does not transilluminate. Varicoceles are also often associated with a dull ache or heaviness, not a painless cystic mass.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation of a painless, cystic, transilluminating mass, the most likely cause is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
