{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions.

She did not disclose her past medical history, but her sexual debut occurred with her boyfriend 3 weeks ago. She is now complaining of a yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge that she noticed 1 week ago for the first time. She also reported mild pelvic and abdominal pain. cervical motion tenderness was noted during the pelvic examination. The gynecologist also noticed a pink and inflamed nulliparous cervix with a preponderance of small red punctate spots. There was a frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor in the vaginal vault. A wet mount was prepared for a light microscopic examination, which revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms. The gynecologist concluded that this was a sexually-transmitted infection. What is the causative organism?\nA. Chlamydia trachomatis\nB. Ureaplasma urealyticum\nC. Trichomonas vaginalis\nD. Enterobius vermicularis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the causative organism, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and examination findings:\n\n1. **Yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge**: This is a key clue. A frothy, malodorous discharge is often associated with a specific type of infection.\n2. **Mild pelvic and abdominal pain**: This suggests some level of pelvic inflammatory response.\n3. **Cervical motion tenderness**: This can be indicative of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can be caused by certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n4. **Pink and inflamed cervix with small red punctate spots**: This is known as \"strawberry cervix,\" a classic sign of a specific STI.\n5. **Wet mount showing numerous squamous cells and motile organisms**: The presence of motile organisms on wet mount is highly suggestive of one particular type of infection.\n\nLet's look at each of the options:\n\nA. **Chlamydia trachomatis**: Typically presents with mucopurulent cervical discharge and can cause PID, but does not usually produce motile organisms seen on wet mount.\n\nB. **Ureaplasma urealyticum**: Can be part of the normal genital flora or cause nonspecific urethritis, but is not typically associated with the described discharge or motile organisms.\n\nC. **Trichomonas vaginalis**: This organism is a protozoan that causes trichomoniasis. It is characterized by frothy, yellow-green, malodorous discharge, and the presence of motile trichomonads on wet mount. The \"strawberry cervix\" is also a hallmark of this infection.\n\nD. **Enterobius vermicularis**: This is a pinworm and causes perianal itching rather than vaginal discharge and is not sexually transmitted.\n\nGiven the evidence and characteristic findings, the causative organism is most consistent with Trichomonas vaginalis.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
