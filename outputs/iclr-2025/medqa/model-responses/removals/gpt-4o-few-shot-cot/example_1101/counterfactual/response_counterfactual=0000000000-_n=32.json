The gynecologist also noticed a pink and inflamed nulliparous cervix with a preponderance of small red punctate spots. There was a frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor in the vaginal vault. A wet mount was prepared for a light microscopic examination, which revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms. What is the causative organism?\nA. Chlamydia trachomatis\nB. Ureaplasma urealyticum\nC. Trichomonas vaginalis\nD. Enterobius vermicularis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the causative organism, let's analyze the clinical presentation and examination findings step-by-step.\n\n1. **Symptoms**:\n   - Yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge.\n   - Mild pelvic and abdominal pain.\n   - Cervical motion tenderness.\n   - Pink and inflamed cervix with small red punctate spots.\n   - Frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor.\n\n2. **Microscopic Examination**:\n   - Numerous squamous cells.\n   - Motile organisms observed.\n\nGiven these details, we can narrow down the possible causative organisms:\n\nA. **Chlamydia trachomatis**:\n   - Typically causes mucopurulent cervical discharge and can be asymptomatic. It does not usually cause a frothy, malodorous discharge or motile organisms on wet mount.\n\nB. **Ureaplasma urealyticum**:\n   - Can be associated with non-specific urethritis and is not typically associated with the described frothy, malodorous discharge or motile organisms.\n\nC. **Trichomonas vaginalis**:\n   - Known for causing yellow-green, frothy, malodorous discharge.\n   - Cervical punctate hemorrhages described as \"strawberry cervix\" are characteristic.\n   - Motile trichomonads (flagellated protozoa) can be seen on wet mount.\n\nD. **Enterobius vermicularis**:\n   - Commonly associated with perianal itching and is typically an intestinal parasite, not a cause of vaginal discharge.\n\nBased on the clinical presentation and the findings on the wet mount, the causative organism is most consistent with **Trichomonas vaginalis**.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
