{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions.

She did not disclose her past medical history, but her sexual debut occurred with her boyfriend 3 weeks ago. She is now complaining of a yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge that she noticed 1 week ago for the first time. She also reported mild pelvic and abdominal pain. Cervical motion tenderness was noted during the pelvic examination. There was a frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor in the vaginal vault. A wet mount was prepared for a light microscopic examination, which revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms. The gynecologist concluded that this was a sexually-transmitted infection. What is the causative organism?\nA. Chlamydia trachomatis\nB. Ureaplasma urealyticum\nC. Trichomonas vaginalis\nD. Enterobius vermicularis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the causative organism for the patient's symptoms and examination findings, we need to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Sexual Debut and Timing**: The patient's sexual debut was 3 weeks ago, and symptoms began 1 week ago, which suggests a sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquired from her recent sexual activity.\n\n2. **Symptoms**:\n   - Yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge.\n   - Mild pelvic and abdominal pain.\n   - Cervical motion tenderness.\n   - Frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor.\n\n3. **Microscopic Examination**: A wet mount showed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms.\n\nBased on the above points, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **Chlamydia trachomatis**: Commonly causes cervicitis and urethritis but does not typically produce a frothy discharge or motile organisms on a wet mount. The discharge is usually mucopurulent.\n\nB. **Ureaplasma urealyticum**: Can cause urethritis and vaginitis but is not typically associated with frothy, malodorous discharge or motile organisms on a wet mount.\n\nC. **Trichomonas vaginalis**: This protozoan organism is known for causing a yellow-green, frothy, malodorous vaginal discharge. It is also associated with motile organisms seen on wet mount microscopy, which fits the description provided.\n\nD. **Enterobius vermicularis**: This is a parasitic worm (pinworm) that causes perianal itching, not a vaginal infection with the described symptoms.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the microscopic findings, **Trichomonas vaginalis** is the most likely causative organism.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
