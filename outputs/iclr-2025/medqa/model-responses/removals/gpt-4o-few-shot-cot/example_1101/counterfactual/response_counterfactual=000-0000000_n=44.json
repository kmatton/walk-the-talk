She did not disclose her past medical history. She is now complaining of a yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge that she noticed 1 week ago for the first time. She also reported mild pelvic and abdominal pain. Cervical motion tenderness was noted during the pelvic examination. The gynecologist also noticed a pink and inflamed nulliparous cervix with a preponderance of small red punctate spots. There was a frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor in the vaginal vault. A wet mount was prepared for a light microscopic examination, which revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms. The gynecologist concluded that this was a sexually-transmitted infection. What is the causative organism?\nA. Chlamydia trachomatis\nB. Ureaplasma urealyticum\nC. Trichomonas vaginalis\nD. Enterobius vermicularis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To identify the causative organism, let's analyze the clinical presentation and examination findings step-by-step:\n\n1. **Patient History and Symptoms**:\n   - The patient is an 18-year-old woman.\n   - Complains of a yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge noticed 1 week ago.\n   - Reports mild pelvic and abdominal pain.\n\n2. **Physical Examination**:\n   - Cervical motion tenderness.\n   - Pink and inflamed cervix with small red punctate spots (often referred to as \"strawberry cervix\").\n   - Frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor.\n\n3. **Laboratory Examination**:\n   - Wet mount shows numerous squamous cells and motile organisms.\n\nBased on these findings:\n- The yellow-green, malodorous discharge and the \"strawberry cervix\" are characteristic of Trichomonas vaginalis infection.\n- The presence of motile organisms on the wet mount is indicative of Trichomonas vaginalis, as it is a flagellated protozoan.\n\nNow let's consider the options:\n\nA. **Chlamydia trachomatis**: Typically presents with mucopurulent discharge and may not show motile organisms on wet mount.\nB. **Ureaplasma urealyticum**: Generally causes non-specific urethritis; motile organisms are not seen on a wet mount.\nC. **Trichomonas vaginalis**: Causes a yellow-green, frothy, malodorous discharge, \"strawberry cervix,\" and motile organisms on wet mount.\nD. **Enterobius vermicularis**: Causes intestinal infection (pinworm), not a sexually-transmitted vaginal infection.\n\nBased on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the causative organism is:\n\n**Answer: C**", "answer": "C"}
