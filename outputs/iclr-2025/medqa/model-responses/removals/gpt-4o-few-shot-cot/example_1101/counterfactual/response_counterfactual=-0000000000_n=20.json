{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus.

She did not disclose her past medical history, but her sexual debut occurred with her boyfriend 3 weeks ago. She is now complaining of a yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge that she noticed 1 week ago for the first time. She also reported mild pelvic and abdominal pain. cervical motion tenderness was noted during the pelvic examination. The gynecologist also noticed a pink and inflamed nulliparous cervix with a preponderance of small red punctate spots. There was a frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor in the vaginal vault. A wet mount was prepared for a light microscopic examination, which revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms. The gynecologist concluded that this was a sexually-transmitted infection. What is the causative organism?\nA. Chlamydia trachomatis\nB. Ureaplasma urealyticum\nC. Trichomonas vaginalis\nD. Enterobius vermicularis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the causative organism in this case, let's analyze the information provided step-by-step.\n\n1. **Sexual debut and symptoms**: The patient had her sexual debut 3 weeks ago and noticed a yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge 1 week ago. This points towards a sexually transmitted infection (STI).\n\n2. **Pelvic and abdominal pain**: These symptoms can be associated with several STIs.\n\n3. **Cervical motion tenderness**: This is often seen in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can be caused by certain STIs.\n\n4. **Appearance of cervix and discharge**: The gynecologist noticed a pink and inflamed cervix with small red punctate spots (also described as a \"strawberry cervix\") and a frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor.\n\n5. **Wet mount findings**: The wet mount revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms.\n\nGiven these details, we can evaluate the options:\n\n- **A. Chlamydia trachomatis**: Chlamydia can cause cervical inflammation and discharge, but it does not typically produce a frothy discharge or motile organisms on a wet mount.\n\n- **B. Ureaplasma urealyticum**: This organism can cause urethritis and cervicitis, but it is less likely to produce the described frothy discharge and motile organisms on a wet mount.\n\n- **C. Trichomonas vaginalis**: This protozoan parasite is characterized by a yellow-green, frothy, malodorous discharge, and \"strawberry cervix\" with small red punctate spots. The presence of motile organisms on a wet mount is a hallmark of Trichomonas infection.\n\n- **D. Enterobius vermicularis**: This is the causative agent of pinworm infection, which typically involves perianal itching and is not associated with the described vaginal symptoms.\n\nBased on the combination of symptoms, examination findings, and wet mount results, the most likely causative organism is **Trichomonas vaginalis**.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
