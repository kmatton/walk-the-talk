{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 59-year-old man complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, he had a burning sensation in his chest and discomfort in his left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital\u2019s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient\u2019s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?\nA. Alkaline phosphatase\nB. Creatine kinase (CK-MB)\nC. Lactate dehydrogenase\nD. Troponin T\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, it's important to consider the context of the patient's situation and the diagnostic utility of the tests mentioned. \n\nThe patient initially presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) and was treated with alteplase, which is a thrombolytic agent. Now, he is experiencing symptoms that are similar to his initial presentation, which raises the concern for a possible new myocardial infarction or a complication related to his initial MI.\n\nHere are the detailed considerations for each option:\n\nA. **Alkaline phosphatase**: This enzyme is typically elevated in conditions related to the liver, bile ducts, and bones. It is not relevant for diagnosing myocardial infarction or its complications.\n\nB. **Creatine kinase (CK-MB)**: CK-MB is an enzyme found in the heart muscle and is released into the blood when there is damage to the heart. CK-MB levels rise 4-6 hours after an initial MI and return to normal within 48-72 hours. Therefore, it is useful for detecting reinfarction after several days, as it would rise again if another MI occurred.\n\nC. **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**: LDH is an enzyme found in almost all body tissues. LDH levels rise 24-48 hours after an MI and can remain elevated for up to 10 days. However, it is less specific than CK-MB or troponin for diagnosing myocardial infarction.\n\nD. **Troponin T**: Troponins (T and I) are proteins found in heart muscle and are highly specific markers for myocardial infarction. They begin to rise within 3-4 hours after myocardial injury and can remain elevated for 1-2 weeks. While highly sensitive, the prolonged elevation can make it difficult to distinguish between a new and an old infarction several days post-initial MI.\n\nGiven the information, **CK-MB** is the best marker for diagnosing a new myocardial infarction in a patient who has had an initial infarction several days earlier because it would have normalized by now if no reinfarction had occurred, making a new rise in CK-MB indicative of a new event.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
