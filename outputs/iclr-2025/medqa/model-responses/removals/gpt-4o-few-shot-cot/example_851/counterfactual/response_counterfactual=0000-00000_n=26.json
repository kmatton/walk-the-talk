{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 59-year-old man complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, he had a burning sensation in his chest and discomfort in his left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital\u2019s emergency department, he was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient\u2019s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?\nA. Alkaline phosphatase\nB. Creatine kinase (CK-MB)\nC. Lactate dehydrogenase\nD. Troponin T\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve the question accurately, we need to understand the context and the utility of each laboratory test in diagnosing a recurrent myocardial infarction (MI). \n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **History and Symptoms:**\n   - The patient had a myocardial infarction (MI) 5 days ago.\n   - He is now experiencing chest pain similar to his initial symptoms.\n   - He has been treated with alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, and is under close observation.\n\n2. **Physical Exam and Vital Signs:**\n   - Pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg.\n   - Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings.\n   - ECG is difficult to interpret, which often happens post-MI due to various changes in the heart muscle.\n\n3. **Laboratory Tests:**\n   - **Alkaline phosphatase:** This enzyme is indicative of liver and bone disorders, not specific for myocardial injury.\n   - **Creatine kinase (CK-MB):** CK-MB is a cardiac marker used to diagnose acute MI. It rises within 4-6 hours of myocardial injury, peaks at 18-24 hours, and returns to baseline within 48-72 hours. This makes CK-MB useful for detecting reinfarction after the initial event.\n   - **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH):** LDH is a nonspecific marker that can be elevated due to various conditions, including MI, but it is less specific and not as useful for diagnosing reinfarction.\n   - **Troponin T:** Troponin T is highly specific for myocardial injury. It remains elevated for 7-10 days after an acute MI, making it difficult to distinguish between the initial MI and a new event if measured in this timeframe.\n\nGiven the timeline (5 days post-MI), **Creatine kinase (CK-MB)** is the most appropriate test to differentiate between the original infarction and a new myocardial injury because it returns to baseline relatively quickly compared to Troponin T.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe laboratory test with the most diagnostic utility in this scenario is **Creatine kinase (CK-MB)**.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
