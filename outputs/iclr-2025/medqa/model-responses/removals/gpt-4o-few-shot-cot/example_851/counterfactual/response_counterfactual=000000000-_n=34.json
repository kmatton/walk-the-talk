{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 59-year-old man complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, he had a burning sensation in his chest and discomfort in his left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital\u2019s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?\nA. Alkaline phosphatase\nB. Creatine kinase (CK-MB)\nC. Lactate dehydrogenase\nD. Troponin T\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most useful diagnostic test for this patient's current chest pain, we need to consider the context and timing of his symptoms. The patient is on the 5th day of hospitalization for an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). He was treated with alteplase, a thrombolytic agent used to dissolve clots in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\n\nHere are the explanations for each option:\n\nA. **Alkaline phosphatase**: This enzyme is typically elevated in conditions affecting the liver, bile ducts, or bones. It is not specific for cardiac issues and would not be useful in evaluating recurrent chest pain in this context.\n\nB. **Creatine kinase (CK-MB)**: CK-MB is an enzyme found in the heart muscle and is released into the blood when heart muscle is damaged. It rises within 3-6 hours of myocardial infarction, peaks at around 24 hours, and returns to baseline within 48-72 hours. Since the patient is on day 5 post-MI, CK-MB levels might not be as elevated and thus, less useful for diagnosing recurrent or ongoing myocardial injury at this stage.\n\nC. **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**: LDH is a less specific marker of tissue damage, including myocardial infarction. It rises 24-48 hours after the onset of infarction, peaks at 3-6 days, and returns to normal within 8-14 days. However, it is not as specific or sensitive as troponin for myocardial injury.\n\nD. **Troponin T**: Troponins (Troponin T or I) are highly specific and sensitive markers for myocardial injury. Troponin levels start to rise 3-4 hours after myocardial infarction, peak at around 24-48 hours, and can remain elevated for up to 10-14 days. Given this patient's recurrence of chest pain and the timing (5 days post-MI), troponin levels would still be elevated if there is ongoing or new myocardial damage.\n\nGiven the patient's current symptoms and the duration since the initial infarction, **Troponin T** would be the most diagnostic utility in assessing for any new or ongoing myocardial damage.\n\n**Answer: D**", "answer": "D"}
