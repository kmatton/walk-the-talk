{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 59-year-old complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, they had a burning sensation in their chest and discomfort in their left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital\u2019s emergency department, they were diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. They have been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in their chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought them into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient\u2019s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?\nA. Alkaline phosphatase\nB. Creatine kinase (CK-MB)\nC. Lactate dehydrogenase\nD. Troponin T\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine the most appropriate diagnostic test for this patient, let's analyze the clinical situation step-by-step.\n\nThe patient is experiencing chest pain similar to what they felt during the initial myocardial infarction (MI) episode. The key points to consider are:\n1. The patient had a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with alteplase.\n2. They are now presenting with chest pain and discomfort in the left shoulder, similar to their previous symptoms.\n3. The ECG is difficult to interpret, making laboratory tests crucial for further evaluation.\n\nGiven this context, we need to choose a laboratory test that provides the most diagnostic utility for detecting recurrent or ongoing myocardial injury.\n\n**Alkaline phosphatase** is typically associated with liver and bone pathology, not cardiac issues, so it is not appropriate here.\n\n**Creatine kinase (CK-MB)** and **Troponin T** are both cardiac biomarkers used to diagnose myocardial infarction. \n\n- **CK-MB** rises and falls more quickly than troponin, making it useful for detecting reinfarction.\n- **Troponin T** is a highly specific and sensitive marker for myocardial injury and remains elevated for a longer period, but in this case, where the patient had an MI 5 days ago, troponin levels might still be elevated from the initial event.\n\n**Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)** is a less specific marker for tissue damage and is not as useful as CK-MB or troponin in this context.\n\nGiven the timing (5 days post-MI) and the need to detect possible recurrent infarction, **CK-MB** would be the most useful test as it can help differentiate between a new event and the tail end of the previous MI.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
