{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A man complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, he had a burning sensation in his chest and discomfort in his left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital\u2019s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient\u2019s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?\nA. Alkaline phosphatase\nB. Creatine kinase (CK-MB)\nC. Lactate dehydrogenase\nD. Troponin T\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To solve this question, it's important to understand that the patient is experiencing chest pain after an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Given the context, we need to determine if the chest pain represents a new cardiac event or a complication of the prior MI.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Time Frame**:\n   - The patient was initially diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and treated with alteplase 5 days ago.\n   - The current chest pain started 4 hours ago, but the patient has been hospitalized for 5 days.\n\n2. **Symptoms**:\n   - The chest pain is somewhat similar to the initial pain that brought him to the hospital.\n   - The pain is also accompanied by discomfort in the left shoulder.\n\n3. **Vital Signs**:\n   - Pulse: 86/min\n   - Respiratory Rate: 16/min\n   - Blood Pressure: 146/90 mm Hg\n\n4. **Physical Examination**:\n   - Auscultation reveals no abnormal findings.\n   - ECG is difficult to interpret, which complicates the assessment.\n\n5. **Laboratory Tests**:\n   - We need to select the lab test that has the most diagnostic utility in this context.\n\n### Evaluation of Laboratory Tests:\n\n- **Alkaline Phosphatase**: This enzyme is typically used to diagnose liver and bone disorders, not myocardial infarction.\n\n- **Creatine Kinase (CK-MB)**: CK-MB is a cardiac marker that rises within 4-6 hours of myocardial injury and peaks around 18-24 hours. It would be useful if we suspect a new myocardial event.\n\n- **Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)**: LDH is a less specific enzyme that can rise due to a variety of tissue injuries, including myocardial infarction. However, it is less specific and less timely than CK-MB and troponin.\n\n- **Troponin T**: Troponin T is a highly specific and sensitive marker for myocardial injury. It begins to rise within 3-4 hours after myocardial injury and remains elevated for up to 10-14 days. Given the patient\u2019s history of recent MI and current symptoms, checking Troponin T would help determine if there is ongoing myocardial injury or a new infarction.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the history of acute myocardial infarction, the recurrence of similar chest pain, and the need to rule out ongoing or new myocardial injury, **Troponin T** would have the most diagnostic utility in this context. The prolonged elevation of Troponin T also makes it suitable for detecting ongoing myocardial damage.\n\n**Answer: D**", "answer": "D"}
