{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 59-year-old complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, they had a burning sensation in their chest and discomfort in their left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital\u2019s emergency department, they were diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. They have been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in their chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought them into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient\u2019s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?\nA. Alkaline phosphatase\nB. Creatine kinase (CK-MB)\nC. Lactate dehydrogenase\nD. Troponin T\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "To determine which laboratory test would have the most diagnostic utility in this scenario, we need to understand the context and the typical diagnostic markers for myocardial infarction (MI) and its complications.\n\nThe patient has had a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with alteplase. They are now experiencing chest pain again, similar to their initial symptoms. This raises concern for potential complications, such as reinfarction or pericarditis.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n- **A. Alkaline phosphatase**: This enzyme is primarily used to evaluate liver and bone disease. It is not particularly useful in the context of diagnosing myocardial infarction or its complications.\n- **B. Creatine kinase (CK-MB)**: CK-MB is a cardiac enzyme that rises in response to myocardial injury. It is useful for diagnosing reinfarction because it typically returns to baseline within 48-72 hours after the initial infarction. A new rise in CK-MB would suggest reinfarction.\n- **C. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**: LDH is a less specific marker for myocardial injury and is not commonly used in current clinical practice due to its lack of specificity compared to CK-MB and troponins.\n- **D. Troponin T**: Troponins are the most specific and sensitive markers for myocardial injury. However, troponin levels remain elevated for up to 10-14 days after an initial MI, which can make it challenging to distinguish between ongoing elevation from the initial infarction and a new event within this timeframe.\n\nGiven the patient's history and the need to distinguish between a new myocardial event and the residual effects of the initial MI, **CK-MB** would be the most useful test. CK-MB levels return to normal relatively quickly after the initial infarction, making them a good marker for detecting reinfarction.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
