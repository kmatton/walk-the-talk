Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A woman presents to her primary care physician after returning from her honeymoon in Cancun. A few days ago, she began to notice an eruption of small red bumps that cover her torso, back, and buttocks. The patient first thought she had acne, but became worried when the rash continued to itch. The patient denies other symptoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam is notable for red papules and pustules scattered across the trunk, abdomen, back, and buttocks, while sparing the limbs. Closer examination indicates inflammation of the hair follicles. Culture yields motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive. What other finding is commonly observed in the culture of the most likely organism?\nA. Pink colonies\nB. Blue-green pigment\nC. Yellow sulfur granules\nD. Red pigment\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient recently returned from Cancun, suggesting a possible travel-related infection.\n2. The symptoms include an itchy rash with small red bumps on the torso, back, and buttocks, sparing the limbs.\n3. Physical exam shows inflammation of hair follicles.\n4. The culture yields motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive.\n\nThese symptoms and findings are consistent with \"hot tub folliculitis\" or \"Pseudomonas folliculitis,\" which is typically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa has several distinctive characteristics in culture:\n\n1. It's a gram-negative, oxidase-positive rod.\n2. It's non-lactose fermenting.\n3. Most importantly, it produces a characteristic blue-green pigment called pyocyanin.\n\nThe blue-green pigment is a hallmark of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in culture. This matches with option B in the question.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
