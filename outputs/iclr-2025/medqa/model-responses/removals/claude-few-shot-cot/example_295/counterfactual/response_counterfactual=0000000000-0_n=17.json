Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache.

She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with new symptoms that developed 2 days ago and have progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?\nA. Lamotrigine\nB. Valproate\nC. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)\nD. Paroxetine\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient has bipolar disorder and was initially treated with lithium.\n\n2. After lithium was ineffective, she was switched to a different medication.\n\n3. Two weeks after starting the new medication, she developed new symptoms.\n\n4. One week prior to these new symptoms, she had a brief illness with fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days.\n\n5. The question is asking which drug was most likely prescribed that could cause these symptoms.\n\nAmong the options:\n\nA. Lamotrigine: This is the most likely answer. Lamotrigine can cause a severe rash known as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These typically occur within the first 8 weeks of treatment. Importantly, a flu-like prodrome often precedes the rash by 1-3 days, which matches the patient's description of fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills a week before her new symptoms.\n\nB. Valproate: While it can cause some side effects, it doesn't typically cause a rash preceded by flu-like symptoms.\n\nC. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC): This combination is not typically associated with a rash or the described symptoms.\n\nD. Paroxetine: As an SSRI, it's not typically used as monotherapy for bipolar disorder and doesn't usually cause the described symptoms.\n\nGiven the timeline and symptoms described, lamotrigine is the most likely culprit.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
