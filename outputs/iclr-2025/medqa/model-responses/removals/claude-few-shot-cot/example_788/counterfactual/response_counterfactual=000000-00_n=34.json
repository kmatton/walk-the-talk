{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash.

His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. The audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?\nA. Alport syndrome\nB. Fabry\u2019s disease\nC. Von Hippel-Lindau disease\nD. Tuberous sclerosis\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient presents with:\n   - Progressive hearing loss\n   - Visual difficulties\n   - Family history of renal disease (father had a renal transplant)\n\n2. Key findings:\n   - Bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss\n   - Anterior lenticonus (eye lens abnormality)\n\n3. Considering the options:\n\n   A. Alport syndrome:\n      - Known to cause progressive sensorineural hearing loss\n      - Associated with eye abnormalities, including anterior lenticonus\n      - Causes kidney problems, explaining the father's renal transplant\n      - Typically presents in childhood or adolescence\n\n   B. Fabry's disease:\n      - Can cause hearing loss, but not typically the primary presenting symptom\n      - Does not typically cause anterior lenticonus\n      - Can cause kidney problems, but less common as the sole renal manifestation\n\n   C. Von Hippel-Lindau disease:\n      - Primarily associated with tumors in various organs\n      - Not typically associated with hearing loss or anterior lenticonus\n\n   D. Tuberous sclerosis:\n      - Can affect multiple organs, including eyes and kidneys\n      - Not typically associated with hearing loss or anterior lenticonus\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   Alport syndrome best fits this clinical picture. It explains the progressive hearing loss, the eye abnormality (anterior lenticonus), and the family history of kidney disease. It's also consistent with the patient's age of presentation.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
