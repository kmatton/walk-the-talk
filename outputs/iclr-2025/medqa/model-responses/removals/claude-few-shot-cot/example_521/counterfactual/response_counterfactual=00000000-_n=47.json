Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient's symptoms suggest anorexia nervosa:\n   - Low blood pressure and pulse\n   - Collapse during physical activity\n   - Self-described as anorexic\n   - Denial of being underweight and distorted body image (\"I'm a fatty\")\n\n2. For long-term management of anorexia nervosa, we need to consider options that address both the physical and psychological aspects of the disorder.\n\n3. Let's evaluate each option:\n   A. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) - This is a primary treatment for anorexia nervosa. It helps patients change their thought patterns and behaviors related to food and body image.\n   B. In-patient psychiatric therapy - While sometimes necessary for severe cases, it's not always the first-line long-term treatment.\n   C. Antidepressants - Can be helpful as part of a treatment plan, but not typically the primary long-term management strategy.\n   D. Appetite stimulants - These don't address the underlying psychological issues and are not recommended for anorexia nervosa.\n\n4. Of these options, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered the most effective long-term management strategy for anorexia nervosa. It helps patients:\n   - Challenge and change harmful thought patterns\n   - Develop healthier eating behaviors\n   - Improve body image\n   - Address underlying psychological issues\n\n5. While other treatments may be necessary (especially in the short term to address immediate health concerns), CBT provides the best foundation for long-term recovery and management.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
