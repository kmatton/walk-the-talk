Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient is presenting with symptoms of depression, including:\n   - Depressed mood\n   - Sleep difficulties\n   - Poor appetite\n   - Concentration problems\n   - Low energy\n   - Loss of interest in activities (anhedonia)\n\n2. She has a history of similar episodes in high school.\n\n3. There's no mention of suicidal ideation.\n\n4. The question asks which drug should be avoided.\n\n5. Let's consider each option:\n\n   A. Bupropion: This is an atypical antidepressant that acts on norepinephrine and dopamine. It's known to have a lower risk of sexual side effects and can even help with smoking cessation. However, it lowers the seizure threshold and should be avoided in patients with a history of seizures or eating disorders.\n\n   B. Citalopram: This is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It's generally well-tolerated and effective for depression.\n\n   C. Fluoxetine: Another SSRI, also generally well-tolerated and effective for depression.\n\n   D. Trazodone: This is an antidepressant that's often used at lower doses for its sedating effects to help with sleep.\n\n6. Given the information provided, none of these medications are absolutely contraindicated for this patient. However, if we had to choose one to avoid, it would likely be Bupropion (A).\n\n   The reason is that Bupropion can potentially worsen anxiety and insomnia, which this patient is already experiencing. Additionally, if the patient has any undisclosed history of seizures or eating disorders, Bupropion would be contraindicated.\n\nTherefore, while all of these medications could potentially be appropriate, the one that might be best avoided in this specific case is Bupropion.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
