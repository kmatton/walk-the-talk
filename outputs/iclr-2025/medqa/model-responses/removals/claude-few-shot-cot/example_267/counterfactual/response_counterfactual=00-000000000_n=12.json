Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, he has no long-term memory deficits and is able to count in serial sevens without error. An MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?\nA. Consumption of undercooked meat\nB. Chronic hypertension\nC. Alcohol use disorder\nD. Spirochete infection\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient shows signs of memory issues and confabulation (claiming to be a famous poet).\n2. He lives in a group home, suggesting he needs assistance with daily living.\n3. The MRI shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies.\n4. He has no long-term memory deficits and can perform serial sevens, indicating that some cognitive functions are preserved.\n\nThese symptoms and findings are consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is characterized by:\n- Confabulation\n- Short-term memory loss\n- Preserved long-term memory\n- Atrophy of the anterior thalami and mamillary bodies\n\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is primarily caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, which is most commonly associated with chronic alcohol abuse.\n\nAmong the given options:\nA. Consumption of undercooked meat - This is more associated with parasitic infections, not this syndrome.\nB. Chronic hypertension - While it can cause cognitive issues, it doesn't typically cause this specific pattern of symptoms and brain changes.\nC. Alcohol use disorder - This is the most common cause of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\nD. Spirochete infection - This is associated with diseases like syphilis or Lyme disease, not this syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition is alcohol use disorder.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
