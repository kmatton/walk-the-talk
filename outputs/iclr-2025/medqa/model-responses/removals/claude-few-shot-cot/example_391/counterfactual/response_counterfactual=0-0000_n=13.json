{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 62-year-old male presents to the emergency room with severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea. Imaging reveals transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. Which of this patient's coronary arteries is most likely occluded?\nA. Left circumflex\nB. Diagonal perforators\nC. Septal perforators\nD. Right main\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient is presenting with classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction (MI): severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea.\n\n2. The imaging reveals a transmural MI, meaning it affects the full thickness of the heart muscle.\n\n3. The location of the infarction is in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum.\n\n4. To determine which coronary artery is most likely occluded, we need to understand the blood supply to this area:\n\n   - The anterior 2/3 of the ventricular septum is typically supplied by septal branches of the left anterior descending artery (LAD).\n   - The posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum is usually supplied by the posterior descending artery (PDA).\n\n5. In about 85% of people, the PDA arises from the right coronary artery (RCA). This is known as right dominance.\n\n6. Given that the infarction is in the posterior 1/3 of the septum, it's most likely that the right coronary artery is occluded.\n\n7. Among the options given, the \"Right main\" coronary artery (option D) is the only one that could be responsible for this infarction pattern.\n\nTherefore, based on the location of the infarction and our understanding of coronary anatomy, the most likely occluded artery is the right main coronary artery.\n\nAnswer: D", "answer": "D"}
