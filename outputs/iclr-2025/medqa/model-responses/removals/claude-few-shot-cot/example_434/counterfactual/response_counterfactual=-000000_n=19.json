{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A man comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?\nA. Ulnar artery\nB. Flexor pollicis longus tendon\nC. Flexor carpi radialis tendon\nD. Ulnar nerve\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient has a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over the left hand.\n\n2. The mass is described as transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, and non-tender, located over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist.\n\n3. There's decreased sensation in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger.\n\n4. Tapping over the swelling aggravates the tingling pain (positive Tinel's sign).\n\nThese symptoms are classic for carpal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel at the wrist.\n\nThe median nerve provides sensation to the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger, which matches the area of decreased sensation described.\n\nAmong the options given:\n\nA. Ulnar artery - This is not in the carpal tunnel.\nB. Flexor pollicis longus tendon - This passes through the carpal tunnel, but is not a nerve.\nC. Flexor carpi radialis tendon - This is not in the carpal tunnel.\nD. Ulnar nerve - This passes through Guyon's canal, not the carpal tunnel.\n\nThe question asks about adjacent structures at risk of entrapment. While the median nerve is already affected, it's not listed as an option. Of the given choices, the flexor pollicis longus tendon is the only structure that passes through the carpal tunnel and could be at risk of entrapment if the mass persists and grows.\n\nAnswer: B", "answer": "B"}
