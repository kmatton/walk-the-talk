He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable.

The swelling started several weeks ago but is not always present. Physical examination shows an 8-cm, soft, cystic nontender right-sided scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?\nA. Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis\nB. Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate\nC. Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal\nD. Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient has a painless, right-sided scrotal swelling that is not always present.\n2. Physical examination reveals:\n   - 8-cm, soft, cystic, nontender mass\n   - Transilluminates\n   - Doesn't increase in size with coughing\n   - No bowel sounds\n   - Doesn't reduce in supine position\n   - Normal testis\n\n3. These findings are characteristic of a hydrocele, which is caused by an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis.\n\n4. Let's rule out other options:\n   B. Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate typically causes an indirect inguinal hernia, which would increase with coughing.\n   C. Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal describes a hernia, which would have bowel sounds and likely increase with coughing.\n   D. Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus describes a varicocele, which typically feels like a \"bag of worms\" and usually occurs on the left side.\n\n5. The description best fits a hydrocele, which is caused by an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis.\n\nAnswer: A", "answer": "A"}
