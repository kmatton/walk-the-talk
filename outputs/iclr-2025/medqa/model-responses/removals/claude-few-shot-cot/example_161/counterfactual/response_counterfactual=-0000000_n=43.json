{"prompt": "You are a medical expert. Your task is to answer multiple choice questions about medical knowledge.\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a 3-week history of low back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\nA. left-on-left sacral torsion\nB. left-on-right sacral torsion \nC. right unilateral sacral flexion\nD. right-on-right sacral torsion\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have a deep sulcus on the right.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nA. Allergic rhinitis\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Mycoplasma pneumonia\nD. Rhinovirus\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's not Mycoplasma pneumonia.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?\nA. Dopamine\nB. Glutamate\nC. Norepinephrine\nD. Serotonin\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. \n\nThe patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism, which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\nQuestion: A G5P4105 presents to her gynecologist\u2019s office with six months of increasingly heavy periods. She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a \u201cheavy feeling\u201d in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus\nB. Adnexal mass\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding\n\nExplanation: Let's solve this step-by-step, referring to authoritative sources as needed. Please make sure that the last line of your answer is in the form 'Answer: [A/B/C/D]'.", "response": "Let's analyze this case step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient is a 32-year-old woman (G5P4105) with a history of multiple vaginal deliveries.\n\n2. Key symptoms:\n   - Heavy, irregular periods (menorrhagia and metrorrhagia)\n   - Dysmenorrhea (painful periods)\n   - Mild dyspareunia (painful intercourse)\n   - Feeling of pelvic heaviness\n   - Increased urinary frequency\n\n3. Risk factors:\n   - Obesity\n   - Type II diabetes\n   - Multiple pregnancies\n\n4. Duration of symptoms: 6 months, progressively worsening\n\nThese symptoms and risk factors strongly suggest uterine fibroids (leiomyomas). Fibroids are benign tumors of the uterus that commonly cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure, and can lead to urinary symptoms due to compression of the bladder.\n\nGiven the severity and duration of symptoms, it's likely that the fibroids have grown to a significant size. The description of a \"heavy feeling\" in the pelvis also supports this.\n\nAmong the given options:\n\nA. Globular 10-week sized uterus - This could be consistent with fibroids, but might be slightly small given the severity of symptoms.\nB. Adnexal mass - This is less likely as the symptoms point more towards a uterine issue rather than an ovarian one.\nC. Irregular 14-week sized uterus - This is the most likely finding. Fibroids often cause the uterus to enlarge and feel irregular on palpation.\nD. No remarkable physical exam finding - This is unlikely given the severity and duration of symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the most likely physical exam finding in this patient would be an irregular 14-week sized uterus, consistent with uterine fibroids.\n\nAnswer: C", "answer": "C"}
