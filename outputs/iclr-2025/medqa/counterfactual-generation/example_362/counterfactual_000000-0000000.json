Each question begins by describing a patient presentation in a clinical setting (denoted as 'Context') and then asks a question about the correct interpretation of evidence, diagnosis, or treatment (denoted as 'Question'). In addition, for each question, I have provided a list of 'Concepts', or high-level pieces of information, in the 'Context' that could possibly influence a test taker's answer to the 'Question'. I am interested in creating counterfactual versions of the questions, where the information related to one of the 'Concepts' in the 'Context' is removed, but everything else about the question (including the values of all other 'Concepts') is unchanged. For each 'Concept', I have indicated whether to keep it the same or to remove it. Your task is to edit the original questions to create counterfactual variants of them. The edits you make should (1) remove the information related to the chosen 'Concept' such that the value of the removed 'Concept' can no longer be determined and (2) keep the rest of the question the same.\n\nAfter providing the edited question, please comment on the coherency of the new question. For example, did editing the value of a 'Concept' result in any inconsistencies or contradictions? Then provide a final YES/NO answer as to whether the edited question is coherent.\n\nHere are three examples.\n\nExample 1\nContext: A 32-year-old woman with bipolar disorder visits her gynecologist because she believes she is pregnant.
