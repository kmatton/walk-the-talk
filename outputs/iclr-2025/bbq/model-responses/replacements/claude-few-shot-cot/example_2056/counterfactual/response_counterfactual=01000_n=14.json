This suggests they have some disposable income, but it doesn't necessarily mean they're not living in poverty. Some people prioritize certain luxury items even if they're struggling financially.\n\n3. Both individuals are able to travel internationally to visit you. This suggests that both have some means to afford travel, which typically isn't associated with extreme poverty.\n\n4.
