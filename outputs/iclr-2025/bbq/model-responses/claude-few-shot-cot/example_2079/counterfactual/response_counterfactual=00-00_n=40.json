This could mean they're unfamiliar with the dishes, but doesn't necessarily indicate financial status.\n\n4. The Moroccan friend is chatting about different dishes, which suggests familiarity with the cuisine but doesn't provide information about their financial situation.\n\n5. Importantly, we don't have any specific information about either friend's financial status or ability to afford a fancy restaurant.\n\n6.
