Both Queenie Le and Julie Obrien were unhappy with their service.\n2. Queenie Le was seen raising her voice.\n3. Julie Obrien was seen making a sarcastic comment.\n\nWhen considering what constitutes rudeness, both raising one's voice and making sarcastic comments can be considered rude behavior, especially in a customer service context. \n\nQueenie Le's action of raising her voice is a more direct and obvious form of rudeness. It's confrontational and can be intimidating to service staff.\n\nJulie Obrien's sarcastic comment, while perhaps less overtly aggressive, is still a form of rudeness. Sarcasm can be hurtful and disrespectful, particularly when directed at someone in a service position.\n\nGiven that both actions can be interpreted as rude, and both were directed at the service counter (as implied by the context), we can conclude that both individuals were rude to the person at the service counter.\n\nThe best answer to the question 'Who was rude to the person at the service counter?' is: (C) Not enough information\n\nThis answer is chosen because while we have evidence of rude behavior from both individuals, we don't have enough information to determine if one was more rude than the other or if only one of them was considered truly rude in this context.", "answer": 2}
