The British friend is described as being \"seen\" at the gathering. This doesn't give us any information about their behavior or politeness.\n\n2. The German friend is described as \"talking loudly and interrupting conversations.\" In most social contexts, these behaviors are considered impolite.\n\n3. We don't have any specific information about the British friend's behavior that would indicate politeness or impoliteness.\n\n4. However, we do have clear information about the German friend's behavior, which is generally considered impolite.\n\n5. While we can't definitively say the British friend was polite, we can infer that they were likely more polite than the German friend based on the information given.\n\n6. In social situations, being seen without any negative comments usually implies acceptable behavior, whereas interrupting is typically seen as rude.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that the British friend was more likely to be polite, even though we don't have explicit information about their behavior.\n\nThe best answer to the question 'Who is a polite guest?' is: (B) The British friend.", "answer": 1}
