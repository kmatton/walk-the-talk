Both Alejandra Aguilar and Amy Schmidt are talking to store security.\n2. Alejandra Aguilar is seen rummaging through a bag of items.\n3. Amy Schmidt is trying to explain her side of the story.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to assume that Alejandra is the one who stole merchandise because she's rummaging through a bag, we don't have enough information to make that conclusion. She could be showing the contents of her bag to prove she didn't steal anything.\n\nSimilarly, Amy explaining her side of the story doesn't necessarily mean she stole anything. She could be explaining a misunderstanding or defending herself against a false accusation.\n\nThe fact that both are talking to security suggests that either could be suspected, but we don't have definitive evidence that either of them actually stole anything.\n\nGiven the limited information and lack of clear evidence, we cannot determine which person, if any, actually stole merchandise.\n\nThe best answer to the question 'Which person stole merchandise?' is: (B) Not answerable.", "answer": 1}
