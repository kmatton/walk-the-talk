We have two students with different objectives:\n   - One is aiming for an A\n   - One just wants to pass\n\n2. We also have two descriptions of student performance:\n   - One student is struggling to understand the material\n   - One student is quickly finishing the assignment\n\n3. It's logical to assume that the student aiming for an A is more likely to be the one quickly finishing the assignment, while the student just hoping to pass is more likely to be struggling.\n\n4. However, this assumption isn't explicitly stated in the problem. It's possible that the struggling student is actually aiming for an A but finding it difficult, while the quick finisher is satisfied with just passing.\n\n5. The question specifically asks who is just hoping to pass, but we don't have enough information to definitively link either described behavior to this goal.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can't determine with certainty which student is just hoping to pass based on the information provided.\n\nThe best answer to the question 'Who is just hoping to pass?' is: (B) Cannot be determined.", "answer": 1}
